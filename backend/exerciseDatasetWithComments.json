You can do a lot at home; check out the subreddit bodyweightfitness.

            "I only started getting in shape this year. I am male and around 5,11' weighing 90kg and carrying it mostly on my chest and belly before losing weight with jogging and diets. I've lost 13kg so far but haven't really notice a change in my \"dimensions\" I think would be the best word or circumference. One friend suggested I burnt up the fat inside me like around my organs first, I didn't really notice a change in strength so I don't think it's muscle wasting but that might be a possibility and also how fast has anyone gotten results from a workout. I recently started basic dumbbell workouts once or twice a day for the past 3 days and tonight I swear I had muscle definition and really pronounced veins that were never there before. Is that possible? I could have been de-hydrated but who knows. \n\n\nFirst time posting here and hopefully not the last :D "

            "Hi everyone. I'm 17 and I recently decided to invest in 25$ in a jar of protein powder I've been researching. I've always been athletic and played soccer and basketball my whole life,  but I'm now looking to gain some muscle mass specifically in my arms and chest area. I'm not new to weight lifting but I most of my exercising is done through drills, games or practices which involves lots of running and some arms and core work outs. I plan on taking the extra time each day to develop a more muscular physique. So I have these few questions that have been circling around in my mind:\n1. While doing my research I noticed that I'd have to consume around 3-5 portions of PP each day, which is around 30-33 gs. Considering my age and weight (which is 161 and I'm 6'1), do I need to consume that much each day or can I conserve more of it and make it last for the next month or so?\n2. Should I be using the PP after practices and games where I didn't do much lifting but was mostly running and did a few basic exercises? Would it be wasteful to use it post practice?\n3. Whenever I bench or squat, I usually just do the exact same thing which starts off with 10 reps of 115, then 5 reps of 135, then 10 reps of 115 again, then move down by 20 till 75 where I do 15 reps and then end the chest work out. With squats I just do 3 sets of 10 reps of 45 and then do so lunges and post workout stretches. Should I make it more intense and change it up each work out or is that sufficient enough to make some gains?\n4. Assuming I spend 3-4 hours a week working out in the gym and apply the PP properly, approximately within how much time should I expect to see some progress or see an increase in muscle mass whether during a work out or visible gains? \nThanks.

            "Creatine will give you a slight pump, especially of you mix it with your pre-workout. Also take another teaspoon after you're workout with your protein shake.

            "I'm not a physician or anything of that nature I just workout with a football team so this may not be the most accurate information but anyway. \n\nI believe 12 reps is too many if you're trying to get bigger. I'd  suggest 4 sets of 5 or 6 reps but with a heavier weight because if you are doing heavier reps you will build muscle a lot faster. When ever you use supplements there should usually be a chart on the back that will show a list of weights so with your weight you'd just find it before hand and then go from there about how much you should mix up. Whenever you take it depending on the supplement you should either do it a little bit before you workout or if it's a recovery supplement then do it immediately after you're done. I hope that helps you man. \nAlso eat a bunch foods like peanut butter, and turkey stuff high in protein will make you build muscle a lot faster.",
            "You're young, so, I wouldn't really recommend supplements. Just eat more foods that are high in protein. When you hit maybe 18 or so, then maybe start doing some protein shakes.\n\nAdditionally, typically high reps is used for toning out. However, since you're a beginning, you're going to see the gains regardless. I'd dial that down, if you're looking for just a large size, to maybe something like 8 reps. I'm personally not a huge fan of doing it too little.\n\nYou can make 8 Reps on 60 Lbs feel like 12 Reps on 60 lbs too. Take longer to go down, slow the whole process down, and you'll get better gains that way.\n\nOf course, make sure you're doing it with proper form. You're beginning now, so if you do things from the beginning the proper way, it'll be a lot better for you in the future.\n\nGood luck!",

If you wanna make sure you get your micronutrients in aswell make sure to eat some veggies. And if you feel hungry, eat something high in fibers, it makes you feel much fuller. Good luck! ",

The earphones I have now have lasted me over a year and still work the same. They’re better sound quality and block out external sound better. Really the only issue I ever have with them is that they tend to slide off if I’m doing deadlifts. Although admittedly that’s one of the exercise where earbuds would fall out as well.

Everyday people throw their philosophies at you by over stuffing a daily workout with WAY TO MANY workouts per muscle group. Why? Because we think hitting muscles in multiple ways per session will optimize your workout. News Flash, it doesn’t.\n\nWhat are the specific exercises that you do during your workout that really hit your muscles hard? Try this for your next workout, instead of doing 5-6 different exercises for each muscle, do 3 exercises that you think hit your muscles the hardest and do more sets. Do 7 sets of 10 for each of those workouts. Focus more on the exercises that work for you instead of only doing them 4-5 times a workout, then wasting time on a workout that is not very effective for you.\n\nMore sets on key workouts will help you build more muscle and have an effective workout!

Then suddenly it won't feel like working out anymore, but more like, play. As soon as that happens, you will find yourself wanting to go because it's fun, not because it helps you stay in shape.

One step at a time, you'll change for the better, which yet again pushes you to keep going. \n\nBottom line. Find something you love doing. And its not workout anymore, Its fun.",

Until two years ago, I always worked jobs that required me to be on my feet all day.

I am fully aware that my fitness goals will need to be met by nutrition changes in order for any progress to be made. This is where you guys come in. I am a six-year vegetarian (please don't ask why) and I generally cook my own food except for the occasional burrito or sandwich once or twice a week. I only eat once, maybe twice a day.

Your arms will always be used you dont need 2 days for them. instead of targetting specific muscle groups, you can try looking at push pulls days. That will give you a better variety of exercises that involve more movements in one exercise. ",
            "In my opinion its better to allow your body to recover for another day or two, try to aviod exercise with pain."

(WELL PNF ITSELF SOUNDS KINDA PROFESSIONAL). On Google it said \"Static stretching is the most commonly performed type of stretching, partly due to it being the safest method of stretching due to the relatively low levels of tension developed. Static stretches can be either active or passive.\" So that means PNF stretching is potentially dangerous compared to normal static stretching? If the answer is yes, is/what is the safest way to do PNF stretching?(Or gain flexibility effectively?)\nBTW is there any video that can explain PNF stretching clearly that I can follow and learn it?\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNF_stretching] [https://www.google.ca/?gws_rd=ssl#q=pnf+stretching]",

I have strength (I was a lineman) But after these three months have passed I have done nothing while still eating the same way and by doing so I've gained about twenty pounds. Sitting on 320 with my muscles slowly turning into fat. What should I do to lose some fat and muscle. My goal is somewhere around 260 by the end of the year preferably. I have access to a gym if that would help, but I don't want to just lift because I want to lose fat not gain more weight by turning it into muscle.  ",
            "Hey! At the end of December 2012 I realised I was getting really fat and I have started to change it. I since then I have lost over 44lbs however I need to lose around 12lbs. The problem starts here as I stopped losing weight. I have lost around 10% of body fat and I still need to lose around 8-10% more. I am trying to aim at average BMI and then planning to bulk.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. How to start losing body fat again?\n2. How to start bulking.\n3. Exercises to work on manboobs and stomach?\n\nThanks",
            "I was just thinking about how much my friend wants to lose weight, but he is always eating fast food for dinner. Obviously that is not going to work, but I started wondering, what would be better, to  not eat dinner or eat a Whataburger? \n\nI'm not looking for a \"Take that money and buy some bananas\" answer, but is it better to put your body in starvation mode when trying to lose weight, or feed it something unhealthy? \n\nCurrently his workout routine is biking for 20-30m 4-5 days out of the week.\n\nLet me know what you think",

            "First and foremost, sorry for the long post. I will try and keep it as short as possible. Second, if this is the wrong sub for this, PLEASE tell me and I will move along. Third, thanks for any help in advance.\n\nMe: 19 year old male, ~155 lbs, 5'8\"\n\nDiet: Not sure how to describe this.. Not AMAZING, but i am conscious about it, so not shitty. Live at home, my mom is a very healthy person so I have the access, but I lack the tongue to eat all green all day, and if I want \"Special\" foods that arent on the normal grocery list, i normally have to go out and buy it myself, which can get expensive.\n\nActivity: Pretty active. Either at work or school for 5-8 hours a day. Enjoy kayaking when the weather is nice, i workout 3-4 days a week, normally around an hour-hour.5. Most of my cardio comes from random pick up games at the court and playing wallyball for 2 hours every Tuesday. \n\nReason for posting: ive never really been overweight, but when highschool progressed I gained a little bit of weight. When i started working out at the beginning of last summer I quickly dropped from 155 lbs to 143 lbs (expected). Since then, Ive slowly climbed back to 155 in a leaner fashion. I have noticeably lost body fat and gained some muscle so the weight gain (in my eyes) is not ALL bad, though, based on the way my physical appearance has changed, i feel that the 10 lb gain was too much weight too quick. Now it seems that I cant really lose the weight again. I am trying to lean out more and i still have several pounds of fat I want to lose before putting on more muscle, though i do know that at times those to things can come hand in hand. Im not looking for anykind of one trick wonder or any magical advice to get ripped or anything of the sort. I know hard goals require hard work, and i am just looking for any advice anyone has that could help me in my progression. \n\nBig thanks to anyone who actually takes the time to read that shit and help me out ",

I'm home for the summer and don't have a gym membership and I don't want to pay for one because I'm trying to save money. My parents eat pretty healthy, especially compared to myself when I'm in school, so the goal is to add some simple exercise in order to lose a little weight and get more tone. I'm 21 at about 6' 2\" and weigh about 195 lbs, but with school getting busier and busier I've struggled with exercising enough. I've started to gain belly fat and want to stop it before it gets out of hand. In the past I would go to the gym for an 1-2 hours, but would focus more on lifting than cardio. I don't care about getting \"yoked\" or anything and don't really have access to a good set of equipment over the summer even if I wanted to.\n\nMy plan as of now is to run 2 miles a day and then do a simple routine consisting of push-ups, abs, and pull-ups. I know this really isn't much, but its better than nothing like I've been doing lately. In addition my summer internship has a soccer team I'm going to join. I don't have much details on the soccer team, but I'm sure it'll consist of a game a week and maybe a practice or two. I'll find out more later this week. I'd really just like some general advice on if my plan is solid or if it's shit and what I could do instead. I was never a big runner so no I'm not gonna go run 10 miles everyday, but I'd really appreciate advice on the latter part of my routine consisting of some basic exercises (not requiring equipment, besides a pull-up bar) such as ab workouts, push-up/pull-up routines, and any other body workouts you think would help me lose belly fat and overall just be healthy.\n\nThank you in advance for the advice! One thing my parents taught me is that your diet is one of the most important things, so once I'm back in school I'm going to do better about eating nutritious meals. ",

I have been out of the gym for maybe two years now and have pretty much forgoten every thing i know. \n\nI want to find a short work out, maybe half a hour to a hour that i can rotate between a few days that will help me destroy the fat around my stomach or tone it down( stomach is where most of my fat is located). Something i can do at home. I'm in a place in my life where i can manage a steady scedule for working out i just can't seem to remeber where to start. I want to tone out my stomach as fast as i can no matter how much i have to suffer. So if some bodies could throw out a few routines i can pick the one that works for me. Just begginer stuff but hard. Thanks.",

            "Hi,  I am 18 years old and I am trying to get a six pack. I only started recently and I want to get a 6 pack really quickly. I mean like within a month type quickly, it's probably not realistic but... Here's my concern. Everyone seems to have conflicting opinions about whether you should plunge yourself into calorie defecits or spot ab training. Now I honestly have no idea which one to use... But given the circumstances I have leant towards spot ab training. Hear me out calorie defecit believers! My stomach fat is really small. Its like a very small muffin. Now as for calorie defecits, I barely eat as it is. I won't go into why but often I go from waking up to about 3.30pm in the afternoon without no food. So my first meal of the day is hours away from dinner. That's not always the case but it happens from time to time. On the days when I don't do this I still eat a smaller amount then I probably should. So if the body did eat away at the fat stored on your body wouldn't my stomach be flat,Ike completely flat by now. And no it doesn't eat fat from other places on my body. I am not anorexic and I don't look undernourished. In fact you can barely see my muffin fat through my shirt. I calculated my BMI and it was 18%. Apparently you need 12% to see your 6 pack, which after further calculation I discovered I need to lose 4kg. But I've been warned that I might burn muscle instead of fat. So I've resorted to doing a minimum of the following: 20 crunches, 20 mountain climbs, 20 bicycle crunches, 20 leg planks (someone told me to do 2 minutes but I find the impossible) and 3+ minutes of Russian Twists. I usually listen to music whilst doing them and get carried away and don't even realise I go generously over 3 minutes sometimes. Anyway, so I despite everything I just said I am an amateur and am new to the world of working out and stuff. So please, be kind in the comments, not pompous.  Thanks for taking the time to read this all! ",
            "Lol maybe that title wasn't too clear. Obviously I can't lose like 10 lbs of fat in 5 days but anything helps right now. So here's what up. I'm 16 years old, and I got invited to this birthday party whom a friend of mine is having. The friend is a girl whom I've liked for a while now and during the party, at one point we are supposed to go swimming. And I'm kinda nervous to take off my shirt in front of her because I kinda let go of myself lately, not having much time to go to the gym anymore. I'm not overweight or anything at all, I'd say I'm \"skinny-fat\", so my body looks like I'm sorta built but skinny with clothes, but when I take off my shirt I have a bit of belly fat and the pecs I've worked out have now started to gain a bit of fat but not too much, you can still tell it's muscle but I'm just sorta worried. How can I sort of tighten up my body a little over these 5 days? It doesn't matter if it's temporary, I just want to look alright at her party and then later on once I have time, I'll start heading to the gym again to keep my body in shape permanently. But yeah, does anyone know how I can do a sort of trick where my body can tighten up the fat so I look less fat and more muscular in 5 days? Like a workout schedule/plan? Or body trick or something?

            "Over the past few years I have been really stressed by school and haven't had much time to workout (even though I am fairly active). I've always been extremely skinny but in the past year or two I've started to gain a little belly fat while maintaining my skinny frame. This summer I got an internship and decided to really focus the whole summer on bulking. I started about 8 weeks ago and it has really been working. I started at 154 lb and am now at 173 lb so I have had a net gain of 19 pounds (I am about 5'11). Essentially I have just been eating like crazy, having a ton of mass gainer, and workout almost every day. The first few weeks I was looking much better but recently my belly fat has really been getting out of control. I still have a fairly skinny frame but I strongly feel it is time to start a cut to get rid of my belly fat. Because I want to maintain my muscle and still grow my frame I was wondering by what method I should cut. I don't know if I should continue weight lifting every day or do some cardio. How many carbs should I take out of my diet (one daily serving of mass gainer is about 250 grams of carbs). I would love hear what the Reddit community suggests. ",

            "Honestly, what helps me is starting with all of the healthy foods I enjoy. It seems like when people think of healthy foods they tend to imagine it as being bland and boring. It doesn't have to be that way! I love avocado, hard boiled eggs,  quinoa,  berries, and Brussels sprouts, so I make sure to cook what I love. It's easy to find healthy(ier) versions of what you love on Pinterest. \nI notice a lot of people are all about low fat, no sugar, low carb diets. Be careful with that mindset. Carbs are in EVERYTHING, even vegetables, so fearing carbs is pointless. Fat is good for you, but know what kind of fat you're consuming and don't add more than what you need. 2 tablespoons of olive oil is plenty to sautee veggies. YOU NEED SUGAR. Sugar is your friend. It gives you energy and makes you feel geeeewwwwd. Sugar betrays you when there isn't any fiber to slow down the break down process in your body. For example, compare soda to an Apple. Both have a crap ton of sugar in them, but only one has fiber and nutrients. Your body has to use energy to break down the Apple to absorb anything from it. Your body will pretty much just absorb the soda straight away, be bombarded with all of this energy, and immediately start storing it as fat because it doesn't know what to do. ALWAYS EAT FRUIT!  What it comes down to is learning about basic biochemistry and nutrition. That will definitely help you understand how to diet better.\nWhen it comes to exercise, do what you enjoy! Not everyone likes lifting weights. It's kind of boring to be honest. Try new activities and find something you have fun doing. You need to look forward to working out! Try archery, martial arts, swimming, dance, pole dancing, Ariel arts, hula hooping, cycling, rock climbing, skateboarding.....anything! There is so much out there. Only two things matter when you're working out : you're being safe and you're sweating. \nGET ADEQUATE SLEEP. You would be surprised how much lack of sleep effects your body. Lack of sleep causes stress. Stress causes production of cortisone. Cortisone causes fat storage. Sleep. Sleeeeeeeeeeeep......\nDrink your water. Drink a gallon. Everyday. Drink it with stuff in it, like lemon wedges or strawberries or cucumber. Drink it.\nReplace sugar with honey or coconut sugar. Coconut sugar is low glycemic. Honey is really really good for you. But keep it local and raw honey to get the best results. \nTake care of your heart and mind. Bad thoughts and feelings produce cortisone which means fat storage. Don't be negative towards yourself, even if you eat like a whole cake in a day amd watch Netflix for 7 hours. It's ok to slack sometimes. Just make up for it the next day! ",

Probably a good idea to actually get someone to design a program for you personally if you want to be the most efficient. A month isn't crazy if you only need to lose 4kg.

It's suggested that it's an evolutionary tactic - your body perceives stress and builds up belly fat to protect the organs. \n Some basic things to do is to minimize this\n\n1. Eat a balanced diet including 8 servings of vegetables daily - preferably calciferous vegetables including kale, cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower.  Get a meal tracker app (like MyFitnessPal - it sets calorie goals based on your goals and lifestyle) and track everything you stuff into your face.  Ideally, you want to lose a pound or two of body fat per week (initially, you may lose more due to water weight).\n2.  Do some full-body resistance training that incorporates compound lifts (bench press, squat, and deadlift).  Use progressive overload to increase strength over time (increase weight and/or reps each week).  I'd strongly suggest something like fierce 5 novice program https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931\n3.  Meditate or pray - to reduce your stress.\n4.  Be sure to be getting a good 8-9 hours of sleep each day.\n5.  Do some low intensity cardio daily (walk for 20 minutes).  Don't think running 5 miles will help - it could actually increase stress levels and cortisol...\n\nAlso, figure out what kind of belly fat you have.  If you can easily pinch an inch or so of it, it's subcutaneous fat (in your lower layers of skin) which isn't that bad.  If your gut is hard, and you can't really pinch it, it's more likely visceral fat - fat beneath your ab muscles surrounding your organs.  This is more problematic and tends to increase chances of diabetes.  If you have visceral fat, try to take milk thistle - it helps with liver fat...\n\nHope that helps...",

            "(copied from another comment of mine) \n\nIt's important to understand fat in the stomach area and what TYPE of fat your have. \n\n1. **Subcutaneous Fat** - if you can pinch the fat and it's easy to grab, you have subcutaneous fat - fat on the outside of your abdominal wall under the skin.  This is relatively easy to shed.  Just eat more leafy greens, reduce calories, and do low impact cardio (walk 20 minutes per day).\n\n2.  **Visceral Fat** - If you can't pinch the fat in your stomach area, and it's hard, you have visceral fat.  This is more of an issue and could lead to more problems down the road such as hormonal imbalances and diabetes.  This fat lies under your abdominal wall and is surrounding your organs.  This requires more attention than some diet and cardio.  Do everything as above, but also minimize or eliminate alcohol/drugs, get deep restful 8-9 hours of sleep each day, and learn to meditate and reduce stress in your life (visceral fat is often caused by elevated cortisol levels (stress hormones)...\n\nHope that helps...",

            "vegetables provide essential building blocks for your body's health, making vegetables a vital part of any truly nutritious diet. That said, it's still possible to have a relatively healthy diet that does not include vegetables -\n\n* Focus on fruits. Many of the vitamins and minerals found in vegetables can also be found in fruits. \n\n* Go for whole grains. Not only can you get some of the health benefits of vegetables from whole grains, but whole grains are an essential part of a nutritious diet on their own.\n\n* Go for healthy fats in place of bad fats. Vegetables are low-fat foods, so if you're not including them in your diet, make sure you're not packing on the fat elsewhere.\n\n* Choose low-fat dairy products. You can get your much-needed calcium from leafy green vegetables, but in their absence, good supplies of calcium can also be found in low-fat dairy products.\n\n* Eat your vegetables a different way or simply eat different vegetables. There are endless recipes you can try to make vegetables go from bland to exciting, without sacrificing nutritional value. When trying these recipes, be cautious, however, about how much sodium you're getting. Try steaming your vegetables or adding a low-fat dressing. ",

If not, can you?\n2. Do you have access to any at-home cardio equipment? Treadmill, elliptical, even a stationary bike.\n3. What is your current diet like? You mentioned snacks - snacks are meals too, it is all about perspective. If you find you're snacking a lot, you're likely not feeding yourself properly to begin with resulting in those annoying midday urges. Lets take a look at your diet and see what improvements can be made there. \n\nThe reality is: Diet &gt; Cardio &gt; Lifting Weights for losing weight. However combine all 3 and you'll be flying by summer!\n\nCouple Tips: Crunches / Sit-ups are useless unless you are already lean enough to see your abs. They are OK for strengthening your core, but do not aid in getting you toward your goal. Pull-ups and chin-ups DO. They are one of the best body weight / calisthenic exercises you can do.

The only reason I know people to do less weight with more reps is to work those muscles into a toned kind or glamour way so they look good and there's nothing wrong with that in any way it's however you want to lift. You don't want to start out doing i.e. 150 pounds because your body won't be ready for it. It's better to do a day where you max out as in go from a low weight to the point where you top out and go from there. So say your max is 100 pounds you'd do 60% then 65% then 70% then 75% and once you've done it to where that 60% isn't hard you move up to 80%. If you're 15 I'd suggest not doing tons of weight cause it could stunt your growth. ",

After each workout, I am doing 10-15 minutes of bodyweight ab work to conclude my session. I typically go monday-friday and take the weekend off, so thats 5 straight days of hitting the same muscle group, which is normally a very bad thing. But I have heard that if it is just bodyweight, and you aren't super sore the next day, then it is fine. Thoughts?",
            "Seems fine. I suggest adding cleans to your workout. And unless you're only going for strength try to minimize time between sets. ",
            "You should be engaging your core the whole time. That makes it easier for your legs to work. So if you're engaging your core you're abs are also getting a workout in addition to quads, hamstrings, and calves ",
            "**You Should Work Out While Traveling--It's Not As Hard As You Think**\n\n\n\n\nSweating At Sea\n\n\nIronically, while cruise ships keep getting bigger and better, with more things to do to relax and have fun, they haven't forgotten that many of us feel guilty about enjoying ourselves. That is, if we don't exercise as well.\n\n\nStop worrying. Celebrity Cruises, for example, has added six different types of exercises, in conjunction with the tony Canyon Ranch, to assuage the guilt-ridden while enjoying themselves at sea.\n\n\nThey include a cycling program where you pedal while looking out to sea, and a \"longevity\" routine that rolls back the hands of time, if not the wrinkles. And all the while, you are surrounded by a vista of sky and sea, without a drop of water touching you behind the glass-enclosed workout area.\n\n\nBut for those on land, those of us who may be spending some time in a hotel room after walking in a great city, or exploring wildlife, there are many ways to work out while on the road.\n\n\nIn fact, some hotel chains even have workout gear available if you forgot to pack some--such as sneakers and pants and tops.\n\n\nI'm not interested in muscle-building while on vacation--but I do want to stay in shape, and facilitate walking and swimming and even standing around in museums.\n\n\nMeka Lowe Teaching Abdominal Crunch\n\n\nI felt oh, so much better, after talking with a certified (and insured) trainer of 18 years experience--Meka Lowe. She has an extensive client list in New York, a high percentage of whom are people 50 and over. I even felt less guilty when she told me that folks can go up to two weeks without exercising before losing muscle tone.\n\n\nBut that doesn't mean you shouldn't exercise while away. In fact, you should.\n\n\n\"I call it an 'umbrella of fitness,' explains Mika (mekalowe@gmail.com). \"It's flexibility, balance, and strength, and you can do them even in your hotel room, even without equipment.\"\n\n\nFor example, you can use a simple chair to do what is known as a \"seated squat\"--standing and sitting, then standing and sitting again. This simple routine helps stability as it works the thigh, butt and hips.\n\n\nYou Can Do Chair Plank Anywhere\n\n\nA second exercise is called the \"chair plank\"--for 30 seconds you place your elbows on a chair seat while your legs are stretched on the floor, as pictured above.\n\n\n\"When you return from a vacation, you change the routine a little bit,\" she adds. \"When you go back to your old exercises, you can stay at the same weights--but you do fewer repetitions to start. Say, you were doing a lifting routine 10 times. Cut it back to five. Then gradually resume your old resistance.\"\n\n\nYou will be getting great exercise by swimming if you're taking a beach vacation or on a cruise ship. And if you're at the beach, an overlooked exercise is simply walking on sand. It is more efficient in burning calories and in making your body work than walking over concrete.\n\n\n\"If you do your 20 minutes of exercise on alternate days,\" she promises, \"you'll be able to retain your balance and other key elements of your body. I've yet to have a client gain weight on vacation. Enjoy wine and pasta.\" And exercise.\n\n\n \n\n✌ cool people read before commenting ✌"

For shits and giggles do some pull ups and see how many you can do every week or something, if you beat last week then reward yourself somehow. Lastly if you strictly only do pushups vary them, do diamond pushups to regular pushups to wide shouldered pushups to pushups where your feet are on a box so your feet are raised changing the degree intensifying the challenge.

            "If you're just starting, first look at your nutrition. You're young and w/ the proper diet you could make some significant improvements. Fatty nuts and whole grains are great for energy pre workout, and don't forget your chocolate milk to reward a good routine.  It sounds like you've already started on some form of a circuit routine. These are nice for toning and endurance, but they're not a fast track to building strength. However you're not going to injure yourself doing body weight circuits so they are a great place to start. Think about incorporating some leg work into your circuits ie: alternating lunges, jump squats, maybe some burpees for burn out purposes. Go to youtube and look at variations for pushups, squats, core work etc. There is a million ways to work your body and changing it up keeps you interested, prevents injury, and accelerates growth. Consider some inverted rows also. They are easier then pullups and work your core as well. Also, if you're not a fan of distance running consider finding a comfortable 1/4 or 1/8 mile pace and doing circuit work between your sets. Establishing a shorter consistent pace is the best way to improve your mile time. It's similar to how you lift. You don't bench 40 reps, you take it in sets of 10. There's a ton of other pointers to take in, but always the most important thing is to have heart and keep at it.

I originally assumed that I'd be lifting forabout  an hour or so for my full routine, but now it takes about 2 hours to completely get through. As far as what routines you should do, it's really up to you as far as where you want to start. When I began a year and a half ago, I started with my core, arms and chest since those were the ones I wanted to work on the most. Likewise, the workouts for whatever muscle groups you want to work can be found in youtube videos or online. The workouts I use to this day come from a workout routine app that I still sometimes use. Another good way of working out is using calisthenics, especially if you want to work your core. You'll definitely need a day or two with the machines and free weights to understand how they work and how to use them (depending on what you want to work). Also, one thing that kept motivating me was taking pictures of my progress every month to see the results.

The soreness is leftover lactic acid in the muscle. As you workout more your body will become more efficient at removing that lactic acid. \n\nWhen you first start working out, depending on how hard you go it's possible to be sore from one workout for all the way up to two weeks. This means that unless you want to only be working out once every two weeks you need to either workout sore or scale back your training intensity until your body can handle it. My philosophy is that if you're still a little sore it's okay to train.

The shoulders and scapula still have additional room to move into a more centrated and packed position. When the scapulae fully retract, depress, and medially rotate towards the spine as they should, the arm and elbow position will be much closer to the torso – a 10 to 20 degree angle.\n\n \"Make a double chin\" is a common cue. But this can create a shortened and compressed cervical spine, which further leads to degradations in postural alignment, shoulder function, and neural signaling. Instead, the head and neck should be neutral, tall, and elongated on the spine.\n"

            "Hey John,\n\nThat helps a bunch. Without a gym membership you can still do a bunch. \n\nYou mentioned a bench press - do you have any dumbbells too? That would help with variety in exercises.\n\nPersonally when I started getting into shape, without hitting the gym, I began with this goal:\n\n100 Push-ups, 100 Sit-ups, 100 Body Squats, 50 Pull-ups\n\nThe end goal is to do this in sequence, 100 at a time through to 50 pull-ups. To train for that I recommend the following (adjust according to your current fitness level):\n\n25 x each exercise, except pull-ups with 10. This is a great full body routine that you can do every other day. You should take a rest between each day - focus on cardio on your off days. Not only will it help with your overall fitness, but also your endurance on the lacrosse field.\n\nTo Recap:\nMon / Wed / Fri:\n4 sets of 25 x Push-ups, Sit-ups, Body Squats; 10 x Pull-ups\nTues/Thurs:\n30 min on elliptical\nSat/Sun:\nOFF - enjoy your weekend, but EAT HEALTHY! \n\nI recommend doing your cardio in the morning, as soon as you can after waking up - before eating if possible. It sucks, it is daunting, however it helps spark your metabolism from the start of your day, and it is important to get yourself out to a proper start. Your body will appreciate it.\n\nLet me know about the dumbbells / barbell situation and I'll recommend some added exercises for weight lifting. Typically you can do the above routine in the morning, before or after a meal. You will want to do your weight lifting later, after you've eaten more and have more energy. \n\nGet back to me on that and we'll go from there, bud!\n\nOne thing: consistency is what will make the difference. If you can't do 25x right now, then do 12 and 13 and make more sets. Set goals and work toward them.\n\nIn about 6-8 weeks you'll notice a considerable difference in strength, endurance and muscle tone. Hopefully at that point you decide to spend some money on a gym membership and you can then really dive in!",

            "Hey IReddit,\n\nGreat job on getting motivated to start working out! It will pay dividends in the long run, trust me!\n\nWhen it comes to developing a bodyweight or calisthenics routine, I would recommend splitting your body into 2 parts: Upper and Lower. You should allow your body to rest and repair itself between each day, so by switching portions of your body out, you can keep working on the fresh body part while the others rest. Recovery is crucial to any muscle development!\n\nI would recommend trying a split like this:\nMon:\nPush-ups 4 x 25\nWide-Grip Pull-ups 4 x Failure\nCrunches 4 x 25\nHanging Leg Raises 4 x 25 \n\nTues:\nBody Squats 4 x 30\nWalking Lunges 4 x 30\n\nWed:\nDecline Push-ups 4 x 25\nChin-ups 4 x Failure\nCrunches 4 x 25\nHanging Leg Raises 4 x 25\n\nThurs:\nBody Squats 4 x 30\nWalking Lunges 4 x 30\n\nFri:\nPush-ups 4 x 25 (last set to Failure)\nWide-Grip Pull-ups 4 x Failure\nCrunches 4 x 25 (last set to Failure)\nHanging Leg Raises 4 x 25  (last set to Failure)\n\nSat and Sun:\nREST\n\nThis routine will help you develop a sense of how to perform certain motions as well as build a solid foundation. Push-ups and Pull-ups are the two best bodyweight exercises you can do. I recommend varying the hand positions as it will help hit the muscles from different angles and really work the muscle. On Friday's  as you have the weekend to recover, I would push myself on the last set of each exercise - aim for 26, 27 - it doesn't matter how many more, or even if you get less than 25 - just put all of your intensity into this set, so when you're done you felt like you gave it your all.\n\nUse the weekend to recover. Your body needs rest and nutrients to repair the damage done over the week. Repeat the following week. If you can write down the # of reps you achieved on the Failure Sets on Friday. Make a personal goal to beat that # by 1 each time. Within a month you'll have made serious gains.\n\nHowever ALL of this won't truly work unless you FEED your body. That is just, if not more, important than the actual workout. Your body is a machine. Feed it properly to ensure that the stress you put on it won't be too taxing. \n\nIf you are planning to hit the gym and would like help on a weight-lifting routine, just let me know~",

It doesn't have to be drastic instead of fried chicken take the grilled chicken , or instead fried rice stick to white rice. ( home cooked meals are always a plus ) As for your workout routine you should never get comfortable doing the same exercise because eventually you body will adapt to the work out and you will begin to plateau. But the changes can be minor as well maybe do different variation of pull ups, push ups, etc. or super set two work outs. As long as you are consistently challenge yourself your muscles will grow. ",
            "I'm not hugely knowledgeable about this but basically the biking and swimming will be good for being active and fit and healthy etc, but unlikely to build much muscle.\n\nFor that, push ups, sit ups and preferably weights would be more appropriate. Personally I'd go with a mix of the biking and swimming (both will make you feel great), plus push ups, sit ups and, if you're getting into it, you could buy some dumbbells for biceps. Pull ups could work in place of that though. There are specific forums on here that could give you some proper advice. Try searching for the Moby Flower push up challenge, that's an effective and fun challenge to take on. Good luck and enjoy!",

But it snapped, and I feel like I'm missing out on that kind of exercise now.  What would be a good replacement?\n\nI would also appreciate if someone that knows more than me would look at my whole routine and advise me on if there are changes I could to improve it or additions if there's anything important missing.\n\nI change the order, I try to alternate muscle groups and start with the exercises that isolate particular muscles first.\n\nI take a 15 second break between sets if there are any, and 40 seconds break between different exercises.  I use a metronome to keep strict time.\n\nAlso whenever I use the straight bar I don't change the weight, it's always 50lbs.\n\n12 shoulder lateral raises (5lb weights)  \n12 upright rows (50lb bar)  \n12 dips  \n2x15 shrugs (50lb bar)  \n6 bicep curls (50lb bar)  \n12 inverted pushups  \n3x5 pull-ups  \n3x12 fighter's pushups  \n20 rows(?) with that rubber thing (?)

I don't lift weights anymore (I do body weight stuff now), because of back problems, but I've tried a lot of routines over the past few years and what worked for me was: training each muscle group once a week with 3-4 exercises (3 sets per exercise). And once again, training is important (train HARD, but keep a GOOD form), but more important is eating and drinking water. The progress I made after I started eating well was amazing, I gained more muscle, a lot more strength and lifting the weights seemed kind of easier. I hope my experience helps you at least a little.

I can still do pullups with my sprained wrists, and I am going to do the TRX tonight.\n\nQuick update. Shooting for discipline!!\n-J",
            "Day 12 - Yesterday surprised myself. While I wasn't able to do my usual 100 pushups because of the wrist bruising (again, skatebording.), I did more than I usually do. Spiderman plank to hip thrust to oblique crunches to side plank reach throughs to full situps...three times in a day! Also did a seven position circuit on the TRX that my buddy lent me. Fifteen reps of each position. Ate throughout the day...mostly sunflower seeds, nuts and then later a spinach salad with walnuts and gruyere cheese.\nToday I am sort of resting, rode about 6 miles on my bike to both the store to get a beer, then to see a friend later in the day.\n-J",
            "You can also do stuff like, Jumping jacks or the plank. The good thing about using your own body weight is you can do it at home and there is so many things you can do with it that it would be a VERY long list."

            "By Nicoletta Orphanou. Category : Health\n\nHave you decided to begin working out but are not sure which workout is best for you? We have researched about the matter and are about to clear things out for you.\n\nFirst of all, congratulations on your decision! Before starting out, think of all those benefits you will get out of this. It is not only a healthier body or just shedding a few extra pounds. Being more active will boost not only your stamina but your psychology as well.\n\nAs a Greek ancient proverb says, “Well begun, half done!” So, take a deep breath and make sure you will do your best from the beginning, because that’s the greatest way to start something new.\n\nPeople have various needs when working out; for example, some want a flatter belly, others want to lose weight, others want to gain more muscle, and others want to relax and take off some stress.\n\nFor body shaping and relaxation\n\nIn order to shape up and release some everyday stress, you can try joining Yoga or Pilates classes. Both help in shaping your body. If you want to loose weight as well, you should also join some aerobic or cardio workouts to burn the extra fat. There are also some Yoga workouts that are more adapted to fat loss, so make sure you ask which types of Yoga are available at your gym.\n\nFor weight loss\n\nIf you feel summer and your bathing suit ringing an alarm to remind you about those extra pounds, one of the fastest ways to burn fat is with cardio or aerobic exercises. This helps increase your heart rate at a zone that is said to burn fat. If you prefer being outdoors, you can, of course; try running or fast walking for 20-30 minutes every day.\n\nA very helpful way for fat burning and weight loss is the run-walk method. This comprises of a normal walk during the first five minutes for a warm-up and is then followed by alternating periods of fast running and walking. If you are a beginner, you can try out and see which periods suit you better. For example, some prefer running for one minute and walking for another one or two. Others run the fastest they can for 30 seconds or one minute, followed by a one-minute walk.\n\nWeight loss, gaining muscle mass, increasing endurance\n\nThere are many workouts to follow in this case, but beware that they are all intense workouts and not for everyone. If your doctor thinks you could join such a workout, then you have a lot to choose from, such as Crossfit, TRX, Tabata, HIIT, and Spinning.\n\nSpecific problem areas\n\nIf you want to focus on a specific area, you should get advice from your gym trainers and they will add more exercises to the area you want to focus on, like your abs, legs, etc. You do need to work out the rest of the body as well, though, to get balanced and lasting results.\n\nDo try to keep up with your workout; you can freely change and try other types of exercises if you feel one doesn’t fit you, but don’t give up! The beginning may be hard, but it’s well worth the whole change your body and soul will ensue.\n\n",

            "Just like any other illness, behaviour,  habit, or addiction that begins to negatively impact a relationship. \n\n“I love and care about you but your (insert issue here) has become a problem and I am concerned.”\n\nKeep in mind though that this is likely to go bad for you. “You have gained weight and I don’t find you attractive anymore” isn’t really something you say to someone you love and care about. Try “these habits are not healthy for you and I am concerned about your health. This isn’t the lifestyle I want for either of us and I think we need to hold each other responsible for our own wellbeing.” \n\nBut even that will make her defensive. She will either dump you on the spot or change her life lose weight and then dump you. But maybe this is for the best. Clearly physical appearance is very important to you and that’s fine. But it may not be a priority for her right now and it’s best if you go your seperate ways. \n\nYou could also try talking with her to find out if she is depressed, stressed, or has some other issue going on that is causing weight gain and try to help her through that. Remember, relationships are partnerships. As much as it is her job to stay healthy and take care of herself it is your job to support her through issues she may have. Maybe just start by going for walks in the evening, maybe get her interested in a hobby/sport that is more physical, maybe suggest therapy if her self esteem is low. Maybe go on a diet together. If you have done these things and have genuinely put in the time and effort to help her and she still does nothing, then you should ask why you want to be with such a person?\n\n",
            "For the most part it really depends on the intensity of each, and your level of experience. \n\nIf you are a beginner in both then that is not a terrible on off schedule,\n\nBut if you are a semi able bodied individual you should be fine I would say for the most part. \n\nIt does also depend on the intensity of each exercise  method. \n\nIf you only run for 5 min a day then you can definitely run more, also if you aren’t doing fullbody weightlifting everyday then you can switch between the types you do each day, and still lift everyday. \n\nBut again the biggest thing is your ability to do the workouts that you are doing, full body generally is not as intense as weight training, and if you are a semi experience runner then you should be fine to run most days with maybe a once a week rest day ordeal. \n\nI hope that makes sense, I kinda felt I was rambling, but if you have questions feel free to ask anything! Good look! ",
            "Well if you are fit enough you can probably run everyday, I personally run 2 miles a day, and since you are only doing body weight workouts you can probably do those daily, its not bad to be doing every other day, but if you are in the mood for quicker gains you could probably do both workouts everyday.

            "You shouldn’t be spending an hour and a half on one body part, try only resting 30 seconds between each rep. That’s a sufficient amount of time to “rest” and begin another rep, if you don’t feel that body part hurting (a good hurt) or burning enough just try the same thing you were doing but increase the weight or possibly checking your form. Google would be your best friend here",
            "Well you may not be recovering from the night before. Take a night off and try again the next and see if there is any different",

            "I’m having issues lifting due to my right deltoid being noticeably weaker than my left. I am a left-handed person, so this doesn’t come as much of a shock to me, but I would like to be able to build up strength in my right arm to even out muscle mass in both arms.\n\nFor example, when I do any fly/rear deltoid exercises, I notice that my right deltoid wants to give out on me much faster than my left. Are there any exercises I can do to strengthen it up so that I have equally balanced strength on both sides?",
            "This deal does not exist anywhere else! Real products; real deal. Contact me for info. Only 2 deals left. ",
            "Hey guys, so I have been having some pain in my tricepces since I left the US for vacation and came to another country, not sure if jet lag could anyhow cause this but anyway, I had slight pain in both bicepces for 1-2 days and ignored it and it was actually going away, but I didn't wait and ignored it and went to gym and had pretty bad pain in both tricepces after workout. Then I waited again 2 days and again pain was almost gone, but it wasnt completely gone, and I went to gym and the same thing happened again. The interesting thing is my right triceps recovered much faster than my left one every time. And now, I don't feel pain again but I tried to do push-ups and after 2-3 sets I kinda felt that it's coming back, so I'm going to wait longer this time, but I was thinking if there is any medicine, any gel/cream I could use to recover faster? There is no bruise or something on my elbows, it's just inside I guess I stretched the muscle or something",
            "I'm a 13 year old guy and I noticed that when I exercise (situps, crunches), the left side of my abs work much harder than the right side. I can actually feel with my fingers that the abs on my right side are physically smaller than those on the left. It's so bad that during a regular situp/crunch, I can ONLY feel my left side working out. My righr side feels like it is putting in no effort even though I have the right form. I've tried everything, from leaning on my right during planks to only twisting my body during situps and nothing has worked and it's so frustrating to the point that I just want to give up. Could anybody give me some workouts I can try at home to help me out? I have a set of 8lbs dumbbells and a chair and mat, not much else.",
            "I just started working out again on Thursday. I have absolutely no stamina so my first steps are walking around my neighborhood, which contains some good hills. I walk for about 45 minutes, a loop. I took a rest day on Sunday, but today I went walking and now my left quad has an unusual cramping with every step I take. I don't know what could be up, as it isn't happening in my right quad. I broke my left tibia and fibula about 5 years ago, and have what they believe to be phantom pains in my lower leg, but this is different. Could it be related to finally building the muscle back up that never actually got restored after the break?",
            " So, I never really worked out. And I guess since I'm right handed and use the right side of my body more often, my muscles are generally larger on the right side than the left and it bothers me when I look in the mirror.\n\n Legs and arms are fine. My eyes don't see any difference. However, my right chest is quite a bit larger than the left and my right side abs stand out more than the left. \n\n Quick thing: I'm not fat; I don't have man boobs. Rather, I'm close to being underweight according to the BMI scale (55.8 kg (123lb) at 172 cm (5'7\", I think) also, I'm 15) and the difference of my muscle shows clearly through my skin\n\n Maybe it's because of an error I made when doing pushups and situps; my body naturally preferring to use the right side rather than my left leading to more muscle on the right. \n\n What ever the case, for now I want to focus on trying to even the two sides up. How can I do that? Preferably something I can do at home since I don't want to go to the gym as I'm a 15 years old and my parents would have to drive me.\n\n Tl;dr - I'm 15, close to under weight. My chest and abs are bigger on the right side. Any advice on how to fix that?\n\nEdit: grammar\n \n \n",
            "Recently damaged my left hand and am not able to use my left ankle actively, I work in an office and sat down all day. Any suggestions on a workout that isn’t strenuous on the body? Just don’t want to gain weight while I can’t workout. ",
            "I am a 14 year old male and everytime I do chest and bicep work outs (not to heavy only pushups and pullups) Only my right side haves the burn after the workout and not the left side of my body. I can also see differences between the two sides.\nDoes anybody know what I should do!",
            "Unfortunately I'm one of the few people left in the world without an iPhone :/",
            "Without seeing anything I would recommend dropping weight (even going bar only) and just do reps until the bar is straight every time. Do it slow, get your muscles familiar and help your body remember the movement neurologically. Then move up in weight as you get more comfortable.\nMy left bicep was bigger than my right for a while and I couldn't figure out why. Then I realized it's because of my deadlift grip (left palm forward) was working my left bicep more than my right side. So I switched the grips and they are becoming balanced again. Residual things like that you need to keep in mind as well.  \nAlso, try recording yourself or ask someone to record your lifts. That will really help you analyze and see how your muscles work. ",
            "Nope no injuries. I don't have trouble doing many other workouts. The only other thing I have issues with is my hips and knees get messed up if I walk or hike or stand for a long time. But that doesn't really seem related. I know that my left side has more muscle than my right and it's asymmetrical enough that I have some trouble with it when I'm horseback riding. I guess that could have something to do with it.",
            "I was gonna say because your aorta curves to the left. But that's just a guess. ",
            "No. Just the blood coming directly from your heart has the highest pressure. So in my brain it would be normal to be more vascular on the left. But it depends how much more vascular we're talking here. Like a small variance is no big deal. ",
            "I'll try the left then. I did this turning it clock wise. Thanks! ",
            "back pain where?  Lower back?  upper back?  Mid back?  Right or left?  Your back takes up roughly half of your entire body so you need to be a little more specific...\n\nBut yah - go see a doctor if it's really bothering you.",
            "Aaah so for you it's from a trauma. I just get it from something. My right hand is the one that has been torn and inflammated and so on and nothing. Just the left side wanting to get irritated. From drinking coke. ",
            "I mentioned in one comment that I'm training circus 6-10 hours a day. Pushing, pulling, lifting, hanging,... My own weight, weights or other people. I do physio exercises for the shoulder weaknesses I have and they do not create this pain in any other movement. Right one is the weaker one and it has never stung like the left one. Just the left one and when running or drinking soda. ",
            "All the murdery stuff. My favorite murder, sword and scale, last podcast on the left.. ",
            "Wow, this is awesome! Also, the thing you went to so many different places to train and not limiting to just a gym or your backyard was dope. But I couldn't help but notice that your left pec is bigger than the right one. Focus next on bringing in symmetry on both. Good job overall!"

            "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/f6f8cgbm5po11.jpg\n\nBurning up body fat is one thing which's guaranteed by numerous [exercise programs](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/the-greatest-exercise-trends-of-2018) however they all come with a single thing alike; the system responsible for it.\n\nSo without further hubbub, let's have a glance at exactly how our physiques utilize body fat. Essentially, there are 3 key steps included when shedding body fat:\n\n\\- **Mobilization** \\- Fatty acids and glycerol are unleashed from triglycerides kept within fat cells.\n\n\\- **Transportation** \\- Fatty acids transfer into the circulatory system.\n\n\\- **Oxidation** \\- Essentially the \"burning off\" of fatty acids to generate energy.\n\n[Shed Body Fit](https://i.redd.it/d00sz76i5po11.png)\n\nWith respect to individuals who are presently lean, within the **12%-15% array**, mobilization and transportation is a huge issue. The decreased blood circulation to the area makes the tenacious body fat tougher to burn.\n\nFor individuals who are **15%-35% body fat**, mobilization and oxidation is going to be simpler. You could drop fat rather simply whenever you remain in a calorie shortage. Self-constraint and understanding health and nutrition typically is the issue here.\n\nWhen it comes to individuals who are **35% or more body fat**, mobilization is certainly not an issue because of a lot of fatty acids in the bloodstream. Oxidation is actually the trouble area here.\n\nHope this piece of science clarified just how your body functions shredding those extra pounds on various body types and weights. Within our following post our experts will be examining a \"**Fasted cardio and the works**\".",

            "So I've been going to the gym for about 2-3 months now.  I go at midnight or 1am.  I only stay for about 1 hour to 1.5 hours.  \n\nThe reason is that it's the time where I can do my routine the fastest since the gym is empty, and it's just an easy time for me to commit too.  The issue that's arisen from this is that I just can't seem to sleep after going.  Usually I end up falling asleep at around 6am, then I have to wake up 2 hours later for work... not ideal. \n\nMy first remedy to this was just to change the time, go in the morning instead of at night.  Isn't working.  I frequently sleep passed my alarm clock.  When I do hear my alarm clock, I find it VERY difficult get up and go.  Granted, this may show that I don't have enough will, but whatever.  If I don't, then I don't.  \n\nSo I've decided to go back to the midnight schedule, I just bought some pills that are Magnesium/Melatonin mix that I'm hoping will work.  However, does anyone else have some other tips for this insomnia issue?  Also, should I take these pills before or after going to the gym?  \n\nExtra notes*  I don't take anything before going to the gym.  I'm also doing IF.  My schedule for that is I can only eat from 2pm-10pm.  So I'm not putting anything in my body before going to the gym except water.  ",

            "Almost everyone understands that exercising is excellent for the fitness of your physique. Via perspiration you have the opportunity to shape and mold your body to your preferred appeals and make your physical attractiveness more substantial. There are on the other hand a number of advantages that are less typically known and because of that, we will go over 5 less known benefits of exercising.\n\n**# 1. Brain exercise**\n\nExercising is connected to improved memory capability and speedier captivation of information. There are reports which propose that it could also put off and even avoid the start of Alzheimer's disease, an illness which lots of people nowadays are sadly having to deal with.\n\nSomething that has not yet been able to be clarified by researchers is yet another beneficial effect of exercising is greatly improving the blood stream flow to the human brain, promoting the development of new brain cells and vessels caused by the protein BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). It additionally safeguards brain cells from deterioration.\n\n**# 2. Increase your overall happiness**\n\nOther than looking much better after you are busy doing your workout schedules and the benefits that come with it (in addition to the admirations), there certainly is in fact a biological factor behind it. Base ding on tons of researches, walking and/or cycling sets off the discharge of specific chemicals in the brain (serotonin, norepinephrine, endorphins, dopamine) that alleviate signs of depression.\n\n[High Quality Fashion Active Wear](https://i.redd.it/qrkulj2r81911.jpg)\n\n**# 3. Live longer**\n\nPhysical exercise has demonstrated that it could likely stretch you lifespan by 5 years. [A new study](http://time.com/4426572/exercise-dna-telomeres/?iid=sr-link2) done on 10 healthy men and women were requested to perform a 45-minute cycling workout to display what it would do on a molecular level. Outcomes of the screening revealed there to be an increase of a compound that guards your cells, which in turn would result in aging slower than those who do not.\n\n**# 4. Better looking skin**\n\nWhenever you increase your body temperature as you do your training routines, yet another less known benefit of exercising is a better-looking skin. The blood flow accelerates together with the delivery of much needed oxygen and vitamins and mineral are supplied at a notably greater rate. This has 2 unique advantages; boost the health and wellness of your skin as well as help wounds recover quicker.\n\nThis is the major reason why it is very important to cool down adequately and to try to keep moving so that the muscles don't atrophy. But you could also think of this advantage when you have been harmed and should certainly do light-duty activity as it would in fact aid you recuperate quicker.\n\n**# 5. Helping your body shrink fat cells**\n\nFrequent physical exercise will make it possible for your body to get far better at reducing your fat cells (every person has them, some larger than others). Shedding excess fat calls for lots of oxygen, when you routinely partake in routines, your body will have the ability to metabolize the fat cells (that in turn produce chemicals that cause inflammation) will reduce and you'll suffer less from inflammation.\n\nFor more benefits of exercising and great workout gear, follow us by clicking the link [here](https://lightleaf.store/collections/new-arrival).

            "A healthy dish contains carbohydrates as well as healthy protein. Comparing artificial sweet things as well as fatty food to treats which integrate carbohydrates and also healthy protein will show you that the latter option leaves you with a lot more energy and mood to work out more.\n\nTherefore, if you want that banging summertime body you should definitely consider stocking up on the following:\n\n**Bananas**\n\nConsisting of a great deal of magnesium as well as potassium which are amongst the crucial nutrients that you must absorb each day. Renewing these minerals to your body in addition to the all-natural sugars (not factory produced), will certainly provide you that little bit of added power to killing it in the gym. \\* TIP \\* If you want to add a healthy protein, take into consideration making a peanut butter banana sandwich; simple, healthy and tastes awesome!\n\n[Healthy Fruits and Nuts for Workout](https://i.redd.it/rsoxcvlt2va11.jpg)\n\n**Berries, Grapes, and Oranges**\n\nVitamins are located in abundance within these fruits. Conveniently digested as well as loaded with power boosters and also keep your body through hydration. If you are wanting to include some healthy protein to enhance your meal, yoghurt would be the way to go.\n\n**Nuts**\n\nWhen you are wanting to absorb some fats (not to fret, everybody requires them), ensure you are selecting the \"healthy and balanced\" fats by checking out the nut section of your local grocery store. They are a terrific resource of lasting power before your exercises. You can also couple them with dried out or fresh fruit. Nevertheless, remember that not every person refines food in their belly similarly that you do.

So if you workout 2 days a week, the food you eat in the other 5 days will be used for that. If you workout 6 days a week, everyday you use more calories from the food you eat for executing the exercises, so your body has less nutrients to grow.

However before I can make some suggestions, I need a little back story about yourself. \n\nWhat do you aspire to look like, physique-wise? Do you have a photo or a name to reference? It can help me visualize what you're trying to achieve, as looking like Brad Pitt in Fight Club is entirely different than trying to look like Phil Heath, the current Mr. Olympia. \n\nSecondly, do you have access to a gym? Be it at home, school, or just in your neighbourhood?\n\nThirdly, you mentioned you eat at least 1500 calories plus two protein shakes - however two protein shakes are also calories, so are they counted in the 1500? If not, then you're actually closer to 1900. But then again - how are you estimating your caloric intake? Can you wirte down what you ate for the past week? Just roughly, i.e.\n\nMonday -3 eggs, 2 slices of toast, 1 protein shake, some chicken and rice later... etc. \n\nIf you are on a limited budget, I can help you plan a proper grocery list to maximize your dollars and get the most food. You just need to let me know what your budget is per week / month. Food allergies / stuff you hate/love would be helpful too.\n\nA couple immediate things I would stop: There is no need to do 200 crunches a day. Nor 300 push-ups. If you are planning to do calisthetnic / bodyweight exercises, you should split your body into an upper and lower body routine that you can alternate. I.e. Mon - Upper, Tues - Lower, Wed - Upper. However if you want to bulk up, you would be better suited to hit the weights!\n\nI'll look out for your reply. Hopefully we can get you on a program to building muscle and feeling better about your efforts!\n\nCheers,\n\nBryan from Friendly Fitness",

            "First of all, congratulations to your decision to get in shape. It shows that you're a smarter person than 17-year-old me was.\n\nThe biggest part of weight loss is done by making good choices about what you put into your mouth - or more cleverly put \"you can't outrun a bad diet\". While the human body is a complex machine, for weight loss purposes we can simplify it to a very simple calculation: You ingest (and drinks can be *very* calorie-dense, so it's not only what you eat) more energy (Calories) than you use, and your body stores the excess as fat. You ingest less energy than you use, your body burns stored fat since it has to get that energy from somewhere. To lose fat, you thus need to \n \n * Know how much energy you'll need. There are online calculators that only take a few inputs (age, height, weigth, activity level) and will give you a reasonable approximation. (Total Daily Energy Expenditure - TDEE calculators)\n\n * Based on your TDEE, set a calorie target. For example, if your TDEE was 2500 kcal, and you want to lose 1 pound of fat per week, your target would be 2000 kcal, as in a week you'd have a deficit of (500 Calories * 7 days) = 3500 Calories, which is the amount of energy in 1 pound of fat.\n\n * For everything you eat or drink, know its energy contents. As you go along your day, track everything. Thanks to the glorious smart phone this is way less tedious than it used to be. \n\n * Keep your actual ingestion near your target. (This is the part that can be a bit challenging. But you can do it. Source: I can do it, and I'm not special.)\n\n * Weigh yourself. This can suck, but damn does it feel good if you see the pounds drop. My recommendation would be: weigh yourself daily, in the morning. Log the weight, because you don't care about the difference to yesterday - having even multiple-pound jumps from one day to another is perfectly normal and nothing to be scared of. You care about the longer-term trend: one week to another, one month to the next. It's important to see the correct trend there - if the weight doesn't go down in these timespans, there's a mistake somewhere in your application of the process above, and you need to fix it.\n\nThat was just a short summary - /r/loseit has a great [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/faq) and is a very supportive and positive place. \n\n\nAs for workout: Go find stuff you like - you won't keep doing it unless you enjoy it. \n\nHowever, don't give up too early either. You probably simply started too fast, a very common mistake. \"You should run slow enough to be able to keep up a conversation\" is the rule of thumb. \n\nAlso, in the beginning you might get quite sore. It will take your body around a month, maybe a bit longer, to adapt - running stresses your body in different ways than walking does, and some muscles that have been a bit underused so far will be complaining. That's just an initial hump that you will get over if you persist. ",

What might work for you may not work for others, and vice versa.\n\nFirst you need to know your goals. If you want to lose weight, then you need to expend more calories than you intake. Go to Google and type in \"basal metabolic rate calculator\". Follow the steps. This will    \nTell you about  how many calories your body will burn in a day WITHOUT doing any excersise. It will also tell you how many calories you should intake per day. What you want to do is get a few hundred calories below that mark.\n\n1 pound of fat is = 3500 calories. So if you burn, let's  say just for this example, 1000 calories per day more than you consume, it will take you 3.5 days to burn 3.5 pounds of fat. This illustration is a bit extreme, but you get the idea.\n\nSince you don't have access to a gym, I suggest researching bodyweight excersises, or calisthenics. These are workouts based on no equipment. The army uses bodyweight workouts only, just to explain it's effectiveness. Granted, your not going to build a bodybuilding physique with these however.\n\nJust some things to look up to help you out, check out \"brendan meyers\" on you tube.  He helped me out alot.

I have done many forms of fitness (bodybuilding, athletic training, powerlifting, weightlifting) and whenever I want to cut a bit of fat all I do is alter my calories.

My biggest change was the amount of pasta/rice I was eating, and snacks. I started weighing everything I ate and tried to keep the pasta to about 75 grams at lunch and 50 at dinner, meat 100 g and vegetables (whatever amount), then instead of eating cookies or lots of bread with butter, I now stick to fruit, plain yogurt with honey or whole wheat bread with ham. Also if you start exercising you should eat every 2-3 hours and ingest protein in every meal you consume. When it comes to workout, just go to bodybuilding.com or even this subreddit and you will find specific plans! If you wanna do it at home having one of those elastic bands (not sure how to call it), a pull-up bar and some dumbbells is essential, but again LOOK FOR A WORKOUT, doing random exercises isn't gonna cut it.

            "First...great job getting in the gym...you've already tackled the hard part was just getting started. As a fitness person myself I can share many tips to keep you going...and before you know it, making progress may become a personal addiction which happens to many. \n\nTip 1: You need to incorporate both a healthy diet and regular exercise routine. I recommend to everyone to download the free app \"MyFitnessPal\". It's a free app I use every day to track my caloric intake...you can even scan the barcode with the app for everything you buy/eat from the store. \n\nTip 2: On Google, search \"free TDEE calculator\"...we need to find how many calories your body needs to maintain your current weight and once you know that, you'll have actual goal to consume less than your daily need to maintain your current weight...this is what is know as a \"caloric deficit\"...adding regular exercise on top of a caloric deficit will melt body fat quickly!\n\nTip 3: Make a weekly fitness routine, but nothing too hard. For beginners I recommend 3 or 4 days a week. For example: Monday upper body, Tuesday lower body, Wednesday break, Thurs upper/Friday/lower. Also incorporate cardio into your week; if you can't jog/run yet, then go for half hour walks a few times a week. \n\nTip 4: Take a body selfie at least once a week...some people like to take one every day first day of the morning. As you start to see your body change it will help keep you motivated. Plus...down the road you'll have a reminder of your old life and use them to stay with your new lifestyle. But be patient, changes in your appearance happen slowly but if you do everything I'm advising, I promise you'll see results if you stick with it. \n\nTip 5: There is an overwhelming amount of free tips, workout routines, healthy recipes on youtube...a very useful and free resource. \n\nTip 6: When it comes to healthy eating, it all doesn't have to taste bad. You can use things like hot sauce, salsa, no calorie sweeteners, etc to improve taste. A very simple high protein thing I make/eat is browning 1lb 97% lean beef, drain.  MyFitnessPal says just 4oz of this beef is only 170 calories and 23g of protein. Scoop 4oz of the browned beef into a bowl and add 2 tblsps of medium salsa  (only another 20 calories) and boom...you have a good tasting, high protein meal low in calories. Focusing more on protein too will help you feel full and is best for growing and repairing muscles. \n\nThat's all I have time for now but those tips are more than enough to get you started. Keep us posted on your progress and stay strong buddy! ",

When you eat solid foods it puts a limit on the amount you can eat. This makes it a lot more likely that your body will actually be able to process the amount that you give it.

            "It really depends what your goal is, and how your body reacts to what you’re putting in it. \nSome people will take powders that increase their alertness, like caffein. Some people take powders that increase fat burning, like Garcinia Cambodia. And really, there’s a ton more. But I’m personally not a fan of these as they make me feel like crap after. \n\nIf these don’t work for you, I would recommend glutamine and BCAAs. Honestly, these, along with a well balanced, Mediterranean inspired diet, can increase your workout performance and decrease your fatigue during and after a workout.  I suggest getting around 5g of BCAAs, 5g of glutamine, and some whey protein. The Gold Standard is a decent all in one especially for the price.\n\nBut if you want the best (in my opinion), you will need to spend some money and buy your powders separate. This allows you to make your own mix, tailored to your body’s needs. A lot of big names in fitness have their own pre-workout performance powder lines, backed by science, and their personal preference ratios. If you know your body, just do it yourself lol. \nFor me VMINO for BCAAs is pretty good. Plant based, good quality, but expensive- and I’m not a big fan of their flavors, but I just power through it. Pretty much any glutamine brand should be fine. I use Now Sports L-Glutamine. Cheap and great ratings. Simple. \n\nHope this helps.",

            "Have you counted how many calories you burn a day? You should also count how many calories you eat a day. Depending on how much you want to grow 4000 calories a day is necessary ",
            "I don’t think I can physically eat 4000 calories a day. I could try, I’m a small dude 5’8, about 130 and I just turned 16. ",
            "You’re just holding water!!!! What you ate is loaded with sodium which binds to water in the body. You probably don’t have that much sodium in your diet so your body isn’t used to that. Also, you were probably dehydrated from hockey so that made your body soak up the water that much more. Don’t stress, and don’t get yourself in the habit of ‘purging’. By purging I don’t mean puking, I mean trying to undo what you ate immediately, your body doesn’t work like that! It’s ok to have a cheat here and there, just keep the other 90% of your diet clean and stay consistent. ",
            "Not my choice it’s my parents. I’m 16 and I can’t get a license til December. My calories was under 1000 for that meal, and my other meal was surely under 1000 so I had less than 2000 that day nt counting the practice where I tend to burn a couple pounds off.",
            "The first thing you need to know is how many calories you burn, search on Google for calorie calculators. They will ask for your height, weight, age and if you do any exercise and after you fill in all those they will give you the calories you are supposed to burn with said data. Then get an app to track down your cals and introduce the amount of calories the said site gave you and I'd recommend to add around 500 more cals at first and if you don't put on mass after a few weeks raise the number of calories with another 2-300 (example: the site said you should approximately burn 2200 cals you put into the app 2700 cals, all you have to remember is that to bulk up you have to be in a caloric surplus and exercise).\nNext tip: more proteins so eat more meat or at least raise it using protein powder. Remember that protein is helping you to repair your muscles so even if you exercise alot but don't take in enough protein you won't put on mass.\nAnother tip: stick to a good work out program. There are alot on the internet, or I can help ya with some if you want. Another option is to ask the trainer at your gym, it's their job to teach you not only what you should do, but how you should do it.\nHope I've been a bit helpful with this info ^.^",
            "That’s okay! Okay first of all you’re on 15, your body is just morphing into an adult so don’t worry too much.  If you want to build muscles and bulk up it’s imperative that you eat at a calorie surplus and have a lot of protein (from meat, eggs etc.) and if you want to get into a routine I’d start off with a 3 times a week full body workout (if you search it on you tube , a workout forum or I can link you to some), then build it from there. It’s not very complicated. Let me know if you need any help. :) ",
            "I tried to workout at the gym but my buddies keep telling me that planet fitness isn’t the way to go but it’s the only one in my area ",
            "All about calories in vs calories out. With that being said: eat less calories than you burm and you will loose weight, eat more calories than you burn and you will gain. I would recommend you being in a small calorie deficit while focusing on lifting weights and getting stronger. High protein intake is key but that doesn’t mean eating and drinking obsessive amount of protein rich foods. Your protein shake wont make you gain fat unless it makes you consume more calories than you burn.",
            "Thanks for your input ! Definitely cutting down on the calories . Doing lots of exercise . Still taking protein shakes. There's so much information out there it's sometimes overwhelming ",
            "read the book \"bigger, leaner, stronger\" it comes with a year long workout program. Also pro tip eat the correct amount of protein for your body weight or you wont gain anything pass the noobie gains. ",
            "Tracking macros?  Or calories at least? ",
            "Bulking up can be summed up into 3 puzzle pieces.  You get all the puzzle pieces together, you'll have yourself a roadmap to decent gains.  \n\n1. Your diet.  Food is the foundation of any athlete - you literally ARE what you eat.  If you eat crap, your body will look like crap.  Stop eating anything that comes out of a can or box and all fast food - you're actually spending way too much on it anyways - the cost per ounce is ridiculous.  Learn to eat single-ingredient foods (Rice, Chicken, fish, steak, and vegetables).  Your wallet and your body will thank you.  If you're working out around 3-4 days per week, you need to be getting at least 2500 calories per day give-or-take.  Get a meal tracking app (MyFitnesPal is excellent) and start tracking everything you shove into your face.\n2. Sleep.  You need to be getting a good 8-9 hours of deep restful sleep per day to allow your body to recover and get HGH - yes your body releases healthy doses of HGH to help repair and build muscles while you SLEEP.\n3. Your routine - without the two pieces above, this part will not matter.  But if you have your diet in check and are getting good sleep, get a good strength building routine.  Your equipment is limited but try and do as much as you can in the [Fierce 5](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=159678631&amp;pagenumber=1) routine.  It's excellent and will provide gains for months\n\nYou should be seeing about a pound of weight increase each week.  This is not a race.  Building up your body is a marathon and you'll need to grind each week.  You'll see the most gains in your first year but sizable muscle will take years.  Be patient and just remember these 3 principles.  \n\nHope that helps."

This really started to hurt my shoulders. So I went back and revised my technique, I kept my shoulders tight and rolled back and loaded them with the \"slack\" from the bar before I made the big push to get it off the ground.

You simply destroy your muscles and at best way they only have time to recover and adapt to such volume of training. \n\nThe second reason may be the predominance of red muscle fibers in your buttocks. In this case, you need to try high-repetition training. Perform 12-20 repetitions, until the sensation of a distinct burning sensation, and better even before the sensation of numbness in your muscles. I suggest that you do this type of training every 10-15 days, not more often.\n\nIn either case, you should alternate the load type to get the maximum result. I think that you need to build your training plan in such a way that contains heavy low reps, intensive mid reps and high reps workouts. \n\nI would also reduce the amount of cardio.

Muscles grow during the rest periods between sessions, says trainer and nutrition expert Damien Mase on the Muscle and Strength website. When you strength train, tiny tears form in the working muscles. It’s when you’re not working out that your body repairs this temporary damage by pumping extra blood into the affected muscles. This results in new tissue growth and therefore bigger muscles. If you don’t factor recovery time into your exercise routine, this process won’t take place and your muscles will not grow.\"",

Pick 4 or 5 workouts targeting your leg areas, like barbell squats, Romanian deadlifts, leg press machine, some sort of lunges with weights. Do 3-5 sets of 10 reps, when you're finished commit to doing at least 10 mins of cardio. I usually split running on a treadmill and doing jumping jacks, mountain climbers back to back for a few mins. This usually takes me about 40 mins depending on how long of a break I need in between some of he harder sets.\nFor abs, the BEST workout I just started doing that burns the shit out of my lower stomach are leg lifts with a yoga ball. Lay out on the floor, put your arms over your head and hold onto a weight or kettle ball. Put the yoga ball in between your feet and lift your legs up and down. You'll feel the burn immediately! Depending on how many days you wanna go to the gym, set specific days for back, legs, arms, and then just include ab workouts in your cardio session so you can work them out every day. ",

Work out your legs to get them strong, you will also need upper body strength too cause your approach in vball for hitting is arms too. From there just do or find some home things like try jumping up the stairs two steps and do a few sets. Do jumps over a bench or something high and keep raising the height as it becomes easier. Also build up your core. Your body needs to be strong. Even if you want to do stuff to incorporate vball actions do wall jumps. So find a wall that's pretty tall and do one jump, focus on that spot and do 20 jumps 3 times over. Off season you should be doing things to increase your skill set."

You can start with just avoiding junk food and doing long walks/elliptical 4 days a week and you can make a lot of progress.

Instead, maybe just cheat very rarely, like once a week, and only for a specific thing, like you happen to be faced with a beautiful cookie, and your gonna work out tonight anyway.  ",

Try to evenly distribute the load level throughout the week. Find the most difficult exercises specifically for you and do them at the very beginning of the workout. Do not do more than 2 such exercises in one workout. It's also a good idea to complicate the task for yourself, for example, you can get yourself to run the next day after heavy squats. \n\nYou can draw certain conclusions only after some time and acquired training experience of different types of loads.

            "First, absolutely start eating breakfast.  I’d recommend a few eggs, a serving of oatmeal, and like a banana.  If you don’t like eggs, you can always get the powdered egg whites but i’d just suck it up and start eating them(decent protein and a ton of other nutrients).Second, if you don’t want to go to the gym for whatever reason, you can use body weight exercises such as pushups/pull-ups to build some size/definition. I’d also at least invest in some adjustable dumbbells that go up to at least 30 per. I’m also a massive supporter of supplements(at least protein powder so you can make sure you’re getting enough in your daily diet).In saying that, I would recommend getting a gym membership for multiple reasons. There’s nothing wrong with lifting alone, I lift solo all the time. Also, you can see who knows what they’re doing and what exercises are the most efficient. The “golden three” are bench, deadlift, and squats but you need to develop some sort of split which you can find really anywhere online nowadays. And who knows, you might meet someone cool who is also looking for a lifting partner that can help you reach your goals and become the aesthetic god inside of you.  In saying all of that, good luck brother and make those gainz my guy. ",

You do not need to focus on some app instruction in order to understand the amount of calories you need. \n\nStart each day with a full breakfast. It should be rich in complex carbohydrates, easily digestible proteins, vitamins and minerals. \nFor lunch, you need to eat a double portion of complex carbohydrates. \n\nAnd for dinner you need to eat a double portion of protein food. Also, add enough fat for dinner.\n\n An excellent choice of complex carbohydrates will be: oatmeal, buckwheat, brown rice, whole wheat and rye flour bread. \nProtein products are also usually rich in fats. This is a natural combination of microelements which you should not be afraid of. The only recommendation is not to combine high-fat protein products and large portions of carbohydrates. \n\nDrink plenty of water. Drink more than you want. Minimum of a glass of water every hour.\n\nIn your workouts, use the basic strengths movements. Use predominantly free weights, and strive to constantly increase your working weights. \n\nIf you follow these recommendations, you can significantly increase your muscle volume and strength.

This headband will take your bio measurements as you exercise or meditate. Thus far, we are planning to include measurements of heart rate and general brain activity. With this data, the headband will then be able to give you live feedback on how fast your heart is beating, your attention levels, and your meditation levels. We’re also considering an additional feature of having the headband stream music and change the song based on whether the wearer likes the song or not. Visually, the headband will overall look like a normal sports headband. \n\nIf you're unsure why your attention and meditation levels might be relevant, here's a bit of research suggesting that there are patterns in attentive/meditative levels of high level archers. Thus, there's a rational possibility that these factors would affect other sports and similar activities.

Mistake number 2 is going to be: Not fixing your elbows! You're putting stress on your biceps this way of performing the exercise and you are not fully focusing on your traps.\n3. Mistake number 3 is going to be: Going forward with your head!

Which is what most of the people wish for.\n\nHowever, you should do it watching your macros (do some research if you don't know what it is). Eat a lot, yes, but mostly protein (chicken, fish, any type of meat), avoid fatty stuff (like most fast foods), and eat carbs carefully (bread, rice, candy, pasta, sugar, etc).\n\nThis is very generic, so you should look for a nutritionist to tell you what to do. What some people do in their diet will not work as well for you, because we're all different.\n\nStarve for knowledge. Bodybuilding.com has nice articles for you to start understanding about a few things. \n\nAnd of course, only eat a lot if you're working out.

You can check out MyFitnessPal for free to see how many calories are in different foods and drinks: they have a lot of brand names listed.\n\nI strongly second the protein recommendation SushiJuice gave you: apart from helping to build lean muscle, having protein after your workout will most likely also help curb excessive hunger, whereas eating or drinking things that are high in refined carbohydrates may very well increase your hunger.\n\nCarbohydrates can help you get through workouts if you drink/eat them before your workout (especially if they're long and hard workouts) because they're your body's go-to source of easy energy.  Mountain Dew would work in theory, but Mountain Dew is pretty high in refined sugar and low in micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) so (just being honest) almost anything would be a healthier choice if you're concerned about health and not just weight loss.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, remember the saying that \"You can't outrun a bad diet.\" Maintaining a healthy weight is mostly about eating well and less about working out.

            "Here's the full text from the blog post:\n\n&gt; I remember the days when I was so fit that a sports injury was always looming but it was only temporary. My fitness and wellness aided and accelerated my recovery every time–even if it took just a little help from a doc or surgeon. \n\n&gt; As someone who’s super-size and who needs to lose ~100 pounds–someone who wants to get back into a delicate rowing single shell that demands a much thinner frame–I have been getting quite a few more incidental sedentary injuries–injuries that seem, so far, to be random and annoying but might be trending towards being chronic and a premature sign of aging.   \n\n&gt; Lots of people call what I am suffering form is called the sedentary lifestyle or, more recently, the sitting disease. \n\n&gt; I write this blog because I am fatter than fit and more sedentary than active. My athletic life used to be about getting as much performance out of my body between sports injuries; now, however, in my heavy weight and limited mobility, fitness, and strength, it’s now about getting as much performance out of my body between sedentary injuries.\n\n&gt; For me, sedentary injuries are defined as those awful debilitating things that happen when I’m doing absolutely nothing at all.\n\n&gt; For example, a sitting injury in my hip or sciatica, a standing injury including an aching lumbago, a sleeping injury in the form of of a pinched nerve in my neck; or, the worst, a lower-back pinch. Sometimes I’ll even get a sore hip just from sleeping on my side.\n\n&gt; Oy vey ist mir!\n\n&gt; Speaking of sitting injuries that can easily be prevented from an active lifestyle is hemorrhoids. Last month while sleeping, I pinched a nerve in my lower back. I took some days off from erging on my Concept2 indoor rower to allow the muscle spasm in my back to release.\n\n&gt; Once that happened, I was about to jump back onto my treadmill desk and my Concept2 and even swing my kettlebell and, all of a sudden, I got my very first serious attack of the hemorrhoids. Yes, the piles!\n\n&gt; They grounded me and made me feel more desperate, blue, dark, and depressed as I’ve ever been from an injury. I was in inconsolable pain for a couple weeks, the sort of discomfort that isn’t just worked out on its own from walking it off or even from a nice walk on my treadmill desk. Now I am thoroughly stocked with various and sundry Preparation H products and wipes and, again, so grateful, as always, to A+D Ointment.\n\n&gt; Now that I am well again and all these sundry humiliating bottom, bum, back, and neck pains are dormant, I need to take this time to get profoundly in shape. Being extremely fit as a baseline is essential.\n\n&gt; Having a default of strength, health, fitness, and leanness means that there’s a much better chance that my strong core, strong abdominal floor, strong legs, glutes, quads, back and neck will be able to better stabilize my skeleton, spine, neck, and scull, actively preventing chronic sedentary issues such as: neck cricks, hemorrhoids, sciatica, and even: oy, my lumbago!\n\n&gt; Warning:\n\n&gt; Ok, here’s the rub. As you and I progress from couch potato to athlete, there’s a danger zone between the two, when you’re not fit or strong enough to support a hard core, when you’re vulnerable: you’re still sedentary so all of your new athleticism will put quite a strain on you.\n\n&gt; Take it easy and spend a lot of time stretching after working out and between sets. Mobility and flexibility are earned and not a given.  When I jumped into swinging my kettlebell for 90-seconds every hour, I didn’t remotely stretch enough after each set and at the end of the day. \n\n&gt; 2016 Four Courts Four Miler produced by Pacers Running. Photo by Brian W. Knight/Swim Bike Run Photo.What happened after putting this extra stress on my body, out of nowhere, is a real pain in my ass: both lower back pain and sciatica.\n\n&gt; Luckily, I bought myself a bunch of massage sticks and foam rollers and was able to calm down the inflammation leading to the pinch but it would surely have been better if I prevented it all by making sure I spent a good ten minutes slowly warming up and then some serious time stretching and working on my mobility and flexibility.\n\n&gt; So, just make sure you don’t swing your kettlebells without stretching your body–learn from my mistakes! Learn from me! I don’t want else anyone to ever have hemorrhoids flare ups if they–you–don’t have to.\n\nI seriously hope you like it -- it ain't easy at all!",

I bought 100% whey protein and I've been using that, but I don't know what the best way to make it is, like do I make a shake? Do I just add it in water? Or what? What's the best way to make it?",

I really like finding workouts on Pinterest right now, and you can make a board to save the ones you like. \n-Also, for pushups you can keep your knees on the ground (when you're ready, keep your knees on the ground but bend your knees so your feet are close to your bum, it makes balancing harder).\n-You can also work on planks (which strengthen your whole body but especially your core, which will help with your shakiness). Try holding a plank for 10-20 seconds 3 times during each workout and build your way up from there.\n-Right now, I like practicing modified chatarungas (spelling), which help with your core and arms. You can find a video on YouTube that will show you what this looks like, but it's fairly straightforward once you see it.\n- Last thing, if you're working out at home don't be afraid to look silly and use household objects as weights! A bag of rice, heavy cans, or my favorite- a large water bottle filled completely, are all great objects. Resistance bands are also great. If you have a park or playground nearby, enjoy the nice weather when you can!\n\nIt can be tough to start, but don't give up, and don't beat yourself up if you're not where you want to be or you miss a workout. The most important thing is just trying your best, staying motivated, and being kind to yourself when things feel off. Good luck!",

Unless you take growth hormone or steroids you probably won't be able to gain more than 0.5 to 1 pound of muscles per week as a beginner.

You can find the detailed bulking macro tutorial [here]( https://youtu.be/GOMxcbG7100).\n\nYour training schedule is okay but I am not too sure if you need put so much emphasis on smaller muscles such as triceps and biceps. You may want to put 2 days per week for legs and calves since they are one half of your body not to mention they are the biggest muscles in your body. You may also want to train chest and back on the same day as well and train them twice a week. \n\nGood luck and you may also want to check out /r/Fitness for better tips. \n\nGood luck!",

            "So I've been doing my set workout for a little over a month now and with a particular part of my workout I don't feel like I'm getting stronger. I use 30s for curls and hammer curls doing 3 sets of 12. I can barley do them and they aren't getting easier it feels like. So I'm wondering if I should go back to 20 pounds and then have the last set be 30? The rest of the workout feels fine like I'm getting stronger. Thoughts and advice? ",
            "hi guys been working out for about 6months now and i see growth in my biceps but feel its very minimal. all my other lifts have gone up but bicep movements still are around the same weight. \n\nbefore i was hitting them 3x a week full body, about 18 sets 2 movements over the 3 days. then i was hitting them once a week for about 12 sets 3 movements and now i hit them twice a week for 16 sets 2 movements. did the full body for about 3 months and did the bodypart for 3 months and now am on upper lower.\n\ni also know its not my diet. currently 5'7\" 29 182lb and eating about 3200-3400cals. 220g protein 87g fats and everything else carbs. sometimes fat shoots up to about 100g depending on the day and what i eat but protein is always consistent. \n \nhelp???",
            " So first of all. I’m going to start each day \\(except pull days\\) with main lifts\\(and ohp\\). Here I will be doing 3 sets. First week I’ll do 3 sets at 70,65 and 60&amp;#37; of 1RM, and do as many as reps as possible leaving 1\\-2 reps in the tank. The week after I will add weight and continue doing this and adding every week until I can only do 3 reps in the first set. Then I will deload and probably have a new max since I hopefully make som rep PRs during this time and can calculate a new 1RM. Read this on t\\-nation \\([https://www.t\\-nation.com/training/how\\-to\\-use\\-linear\\-periodization](https://www.t-nation.com/training/how-to-use-linear-periodization)\\) But i will not add 10lbs to bench as said in the article cuz it is too much for me since im weak in presses \\(long arms....\\). Ill add 5lbs on Bench and OHP, 10 lbs on squat, and 20 lbs on DL, each week. These lifts are listed as \"3xLP\" since there is no target rep. And ofc if i for example do 15 x 100lbs at bench one week I will try to do 15 x105lbs next week.\n\nI wanna do PPLrPPLrPPLr and so on.

            "So I’ve been through many different workout regimes. I used to be fat, like 16st and then one day I decided to get fit (back story - I had a kid, decided I didn’t wanna be a “fat dad”). \n\nI ran. Started off just 500m or so and eventually I was doing half marathons. I lost a ton of fat but I wasn’t toned. Someone suggested weights because you burn more energy and build muscle too. So I did that, all different types of regimes, 5 day weeks, 3 day splits, 5x5 you name it. But I could feel my stamina leaving me and I didn’t have time to run / cycle as well as train for an hour in the gym.\n\nI knew about HIIT for fat loss and so I thought, why not combine the two? Speedy workouts, focusing on form and speed with combined cardio elements and strength training. I’ve only been following for 2 weeks but I’ve really enjoyed it so far.

I have also notices that they also get slower and they \"lose\" \ntechnique.My coach give me a neurological expain for that, and told me that this is not that an athlete sould try to do .So is there a way to get stronger but stay in the same size (or at least get the minimun grown in size) ? And if there is then how ? (number of sets ? volume in every set ?intensity in every set ? resting between? how many exercise per musle group?what split in days ?)\n2) Through my seacher on internet and some practical experience i have understan that some movements are meant to \"feel\" right because by watching someone doing them u cannot always separate which are performed in the right way and wich they are performed wrong.Plus use of bad technique can lead to some pretty bad injuries .\nα)Is a deadlift \"feeling\" like pushing your hip forward or like lifting with your back and try to stand upright ?\nβ)Is a pull up \"feeling\" to start form an active grip or being in an angled position trying to make your chest touch the bar ?\nγ)Is a  low bar squat \"feeling\" like pushing your but behind ( even if u stoop a little) and bringin it back or like poitning out your knees( not farther that the egde of your feet) and keep your torso in straight line ?\nI ma asking those question about this exerceses cause i feel like the can be a good use in a strength program \nThanks u for all your answers in advice and for your time spend ....(and for SORRY the awfull english)",

            "I can recommend that you combine your training of the biceps and triceps in one workout. It is necessary to alternate the exercises for the biceps and triceps in this workout, this will ensure maximum blood flow to your arms. Exercises with dumbbells are perfect for your case and will help prepare and warm up your joints and ligaments. It is very important to choose exercises that will not hurt and discomfort you. I do not know what kind of shoulder injury you had, but I want to recommend you perform warm-up exercises for shoulder rotators before any bench training. ",
            "According to the latest scientific researches, the resting time between sets/exercises (either 30s or 3m) does not have any impact on hypertrophy. So it really narrows down to what you like the most: more reps or less reps, etc.",

            "what exercises should I be doing? and how many? like 12 reps and then rest for some time?",
            "Any suggestions regarding what exercises, how many reps, sets etc? ",
            "Start with a lot of body weight exercises. Go for holding the contraction for time, and don’t focus on adding extra weight. As you become proportionally stronger you could switch to exercises that add weight. \nIf you feel like that is bullshit advice (which it’s not) and you really want to “lift weights” from the start, then start with a lighter weight to begin and focus on eccentric contractions for the major muscle groups (e.g. squats that have a 5 second lowering down and then a 1-2 second powerful return to standing, or bench press that is slow to lower the bar to the chest and powerful to return to neutral.)\n\nStudies have shown that eccentric exercises actually produce more muscle hypertrophy than concentric exercises alone. \n\nThe 6 major muscle groups are back, chest, shoulders, arms, legs, and calves. I didn’t include abdominals because you should engage your abs throughout all of your exercises, regardless of the muscle group. And abs are easy to add in at the end of any workout. Make sure to train each muscle group at least once a week, whether that means you are doing a lot of full body exercises (squat to bicep curl to shoulder press combination for example) or you isolate each group and do several exercises targeting the ones you would like. \n\nEach person has their own workout recipe. Some people have a super furnace of an oven, while other people have to duct tape the door and finagle with the knobs to get theirs to work well. Everyone is different. And it takes a long time of consistent work to see noticeable results. I say this so that you don’t get discouraged and try to overshoot your capabilities early on. \n\nBackground: I have my bachelors in kinesiology. "

I have extreme pain in biceps post workout..not the same day...but second day...or if I a doing legs...same shit...my knees and quads are sore....I pop pain killer since protein shakes, cold showeres, etc don't seem to help...what else can I do here. Its hamstrung my routine...i can't get out there without a day or sometimes two of complete rest and I see its not the case for my workout buddies...same routine...same job...what the helll????

            "You shouldnt do biceps several times a week. Hit your biceps hard once or twice a week. Heavy weights 4-6 reps. Then let them rest. Muscle doesnt grow if you dont let it rest.",
            "This is common - and don't equate soreness to whether your biceps are growing or not... They are a problem for many.  On your back/bicep day, be sure to include pull-ups - these stimulate your CNS (Central Nervous System) greatly... When doing curls, be sure to go all the way down and feel that stretch in the bicep - that's critical.  Also, be sure to do a hammer curl to stimulate the short head of the bicep and the brachialis which helps with the \"peak\" or ball...  On your days off, be sure to stretch you biceps - this is a much avoided technique to increase size...\n\nAlso, as u/pelayogilberto states - go heavy and do 3 or 5 set of 4-6 reps...  but over all, you shouldn't do more than 15-20 sets per week on biceps...  I'd also suggest not doing splits like you're doing - they're great for 'enhanced' lifters, but for naturals, I'd suggest a full body workout... I have examples if you're interested...",

            "I just found this article and the dude in the pics seems to be curling about the same amount I curl yet his biceps are much bigger than mine...\n\nhttps://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/drobson215.htm\n\n...how much would you say is on those dumbells? It doesn't look like a lot of weight. It's got to be more than it looks, but it looks to me the same as I'm currently using, which is only 30lbs on the dumbbells (the guy apparently curling about 30lbs on the barbells looks ridiculous unless he's going reeeaaal slooow). \n\nI was just admiring these \"massive pythons\" of mine and realizing it's not much progress considering I've been working out religiously since about May.\n\nMy basic routine is 4 sets of dumbell curls (10 each arm), hammer curls, then barbell curls and wide barbell curls. \n\nLately, I've been going back and doing more reps of each after at a slightly reduced weight because it's easy to do and I was just hoping it would help. It seems to have helped because in the past month I was able to increase my barbell curls from 40 to 60lbs and my dumbbell curls from 20 to 30...but, honestly, I feel like maybe I could have increased the poundage a while ago. I was just trying to do it the \"right way\" by not overtraining and by not cheating by jerking my body around.\n\nAnd speaking of overtraining, that conundrum is exactly why I ask. After this amount of reps at 30lbs and 60 lbs for dumbbell and barbell respectively, I am shot. It definitely is my limit. So, I wonder how long it will be before I can lift more. And what I'm lifting right now is not making the big biceps. Yet, if I tried to lift more, (A) I couldn't, (B) I would probably break my wrists and elbows right off as the weights slammed into the floor.",
            "hey thanks for the reply.\nit could be this though am not sure.\ni feel almost fine now..  though there is a bit of pain when i move my head to the extreme left or right.\nthe thing is i wanted to figure out what am doing wrong.\nshould i not be increasing weight gradually..i mean... i was doing barbell curl without any weights and was able to do 12 reps in 2 sets each easily. so i thought of increasing the weight but this happened.\nthough there could be something wrong with my posture or form and i do understand it.",

            "I'm not an expert so take this worth a grain of salt, but if you still have the movement I would think a prosthetic that would gain stability from being strapped to your leg would be handy. An extension would stick out where your foot would be. You could then use rubber bands for exercises and if comfortable body weight calf raises. Hopefully someone has a more price efficient solution.",
            "Any chance you can share an image of footwear?\n\nYour calf flexes your foot. The longer the foot is, the harder the calf has to work (its loose idea, but important). Point out the obvious you are missing the larger length of the foot; however, you have the shorter length :)\n\nYour best bet (without a prosthetic) will be to hold a resistant band, put your heel on it and rotate your heel out.\n\nHowever if your manage to get a prosthetic or get proper shoe wear (extending your foot) you can do more things.",
            "And in case you didn't understand that if you do 15 calf raises and stop that equals 1 set. Do that three times and you got yourself 3 sets. \n\nJoeLionfish is correct. Calf raises alone will not help your vertical very much. "

Now, I've developed plantar fasciitis in the same foot.\n\nMy eating habits have been on point, and I've lost 11 pounds in the past 2 months. I'm not worried about that part.\n I am just curious if anyone can suggest some exercises or workouts that use the feet very lightly. I do swim 3 times a week, for about 45-1:15 mins. I have been trying some upper body lifting, but I don't want to ignore lower body either. Thanks!",
            "Most people's feet suck because they've never trained barefoot. So they're usually pronated or have a lack of an arch. Shoes ruin our foot biomechanics. So if you've never done that expect some soreness. Look up \"short foot\" exercises if you do get sore. A yoga mat will help by reducing impact forces a little bit. "

Or they cater to that demographic more than other shoe companies.\n\nHe then discovered that my large toes were being hurt from the toenails. Go figure,  my aunt and uncle both had the same issue.  So he trimmed them down in an out patient procedure. \n\nThen he prescribed constant daily stretches for my calf’s and quads to battle their constant pulling on ligaments in the foot.  He said this is a life time struggle.  And various foot exercises to build up the muscles in the front of my calf to also fight the back leg muscles.  If I skip exercises or stretching , I can feel it getting worse pretty quickly.\n\nWith my particular issues he said avoid running, standing around.  Walking was good.  \n\nHe said that the best cardio for me was the bike, as long as I was sitting. Or swimming.\n\n\nWhen i started out I saw him every 4 to 5 weeks ( thank goodness for insurance).  Now that I’m “better”.  I’ve been seeing him for about 4-5 years every 6 months.  To make sure I’m on track or to kick me in the rear when I get lazy on the exercises for the feet.\n\n\nPlease see the doctor/ specialist.

If you can calf raise your body weight easily, you have to be able to do much more than 5. If you do 5 kilos  honestly just don't do it at all. With only 15 reps that's nothing for 5 kilos. I'm 16 years old and I can do 300 lbs calf raise ~ 25 reps. 5 is not enough, just letting you know, you probably wont improve anything with that low of weight"

Problem is I never feel as though I've done much when I cycle. \n\nHow do I still get an efficient workout without having to rely on my knee for support ",
            "**Tl;dr at bottom**\n\nSo basically, I’m 18, played football for the past 12 years, *lineman*, am 235-40-ish...\nAnd had a knee injury my senior year in HS, not needing surgery bad, but I missed a week of practice.\n\n\nLately I feel like my knee**s** have been getting weaker, and I injured my right knee but for some reason I feel like my left knee is getting weaker too, I *usually* use a sleeve, *one of the ones that slides on your knee and has those 2 strips of plastic on the sides that bend*, whenever I workout, and I use it pretty often on a daily basis....\nBut I had to skip leg day this week, because my knee was just hurting &amp; feeling weak, it seems to be slowly getting worse and I just wanna see if there’s anything I can do to help it before it gets bad.\n\nFor reference, my squat max, is probably somewhere around 300-ish, not trying to be a power lifter, just don’t want chicken legs, haven’t maxed out since HS though since it doesn’t really matter. For leg days I usually do squats, a few leg machines, and at least 30 mins of cardio on the bicycle.\n\n**THANKS!**\n\nTl;dr - I fucked up one of my knees in HS football, it seems to be getting weaker, what can I do to help it?",
            "A little bit of context to the situation; I injured my knee after taking a month break from running. I guess I ran a bit too enthusiastically and injured it in the process. It had been hurting for approximately two weeks, to date. I decided to go to the doctor two days ago, because I can not stay still (I need to remain active). They only did an x- ray (no broken bones) which should be the case. These past two weeks I have been applying ointments/patches, massaging it, using a band and I just took some Tylenol yesterday early afternoon(first time). Today after sleeping with an ice pack under my knee-pit propped by a pillow I woke up with no pain. Should I still go get an MRI done, as I hope to increase the intensity of my workouts if my knee continues to feel just fine?\n\n\\*Maybe someone has experienced something similar, as I am sure there are some runners here. Your insight and personal experience on this situation would be greatly appreciated.\\* \n\nThank you, ",

Next to the massage and frictions it is very important to strengen the calfs as well. What the physicist Let me do was the following. Side note: a tendon can't really be stretched. Muscles can. That's at least what they told me. \n\nStretch with one foot on the stairs and one hanging on the edge and putting Your weight on the hanging foot. See example here. http://www.wfaac.com.au/blog/why-am-i-stretching-my-calves-the-importance-of-calf-stretching\nDo the same with your knee bend as a second one. Always 30 seconds. \n\nBut as I said before it is more important to strenghten the calfs. And increase the intensity very slowly. That is at least what's working in my case. I can give you a few exercises when needed. 😋 \n\nEdit: I'm not a doctor. Don't take this as real medical advise. I am Just writing down a part of my treatment. Wish you lots of success!",

            "Good Nutrition is very important. It is your nutrition that allows your body to effectively rebuild after a workout. There is an abundance of info about best practices for nutrition plans and ultimately you have to find one that works best for you (many people might have specific dietary needs). Just make sure that you are eating clean, mostly whole foods (that is no junk food or processed foods, packaged prepared foods) and try to reduce your consumption of fat. \n\nAs far as the chest muscle development, there are a lot of workouts that can effectively engage the chest. Try including resistance bands in your workouts. The bands place constant stimulation on the engaged muscle throughout the entire movement of the exercise. They create a sort of muscle stimulus that lifting with weights can't duplicate and can improve your gains and lifting ability in the gym. Look on YouTube for resistance band chest workouts. \n\n[**-BodyLaunch.com**](http://body-launch.com/welcome)"

            "The bench press and pull ups are both compound movements... meaning you're using more than one muscle. You can improve those two movements by working on the secondary muscles and strengthening those! You can also try doing parts of the movement as opposed to the whole movement. For example, if you have trouble with the bottom of your bench press, you can lower the weight, and pause at the bottom of the press. This will strengthen the bottom of the movement and thus, increase the amount of weight you can push!",
            "I've been trying to do this the better part of 20 years and let me tell you food is the biggest obstacle to thigh fat, I simply can not exercise enough to make a dint in it without eating the small meals.  I like a few beers on the weekend and a slice of cake or three.  It's taken a lot of getting used to, but I eat small healthy meals during the week, mostly salads and veggie meals with quorn, so I can enjoy the shit out of some nice calories on the weekend. Low fat hot drinks, coffee and green tea and lots of water get me through the peckish times during the week.  When I finally got my eating organised, I finally began to get control of my body fat.  For exercise I mainly do fast walking of a two miles, then a kind if 5×5 exercise routine (you tube is your best friend - look up beginners 5×5), like squats Deadlifts bench press, overhead press, and that one that looks like a dog having a piss,  etc.  Those exercises may seem like they are only for body builders, but with lighter hand weights they are a super quick workout and super effective.  I use my old step as a bench with a towel in it for the bench press.  My set of hand weights only go up to 6kg and its plenty. I hope this helps, never give up! ",
            "Thats what I would recommend unless there is some very specific reason or imbalance that makes you want to prioritize a secondary movement like tricep extensions over bench and overhead press. The triceps should generally come along for the ride with your bench progression and maybe a small amount of supplemental work."

            "hey!\n\nI am an amateur and by no means a personal trainer or pro. However, I have been lifting for going on 5 years and lift 245 bench, 405 squat, and 405 dead lift and weigh 175 currently. A flat chest and stomahc is up to you. The heavier you are the stronger you will naturally be usually. Personally I found the most success aesthetically from a lower-ish carb diet. Meaning I dont count macros but rather keep track of the relaive amount of grains/ carbs I eat in a day. Usually I find that eating carbs up until noon and then a small amount after lifting to be a key to building muscle. I know this is a very broad answer but essentially a bowl of cereal for breakfast, some bread or a small plate of pasta for at lunch and then a small amount of rice or any carbs after lifting. Your muscles need to restore their energy stores after a workout in order to grow and recover properly. Also most protein bars are glorified candy bars and you are better off with protein shakes in that department.  Your reps and sets will define the way your body grows and develops. Lower reps and more sets are great for strength and making your muscles denser (not larger in appearance but more solid). Higher reps and fewer sets (and less rest) will hypetrophy your muscles and make them appear larger and better for endurance. If you chose to go with the higher reps and sets you will need more carbs and more calories in general. Eating 5 small meals a day in my experience as excellent for muscle building. If you are hungry, your body is out of fuel to digest and will begin digesting stores (your fat and muscles). Personally I found the most success by hitting 2-3 compound lifts at 5x5 then doing secondary groups 3x8/12. I.E. chest day 5x5 bench 5x5 incline 5x5 decline, chest flys 3x8, weighted dips 3x8, tricep extension 3x8, diamond pushups 3x8. \n\n\nSorry for the wordy response,  but overall, experiment with different rep and set combos to see what volume is best for you, as well as your food intake in comparison to your workouts. Best of luck and just keep researching!"

My strength always goes through the roof and I end up with a 2xx bench press and a lot of weight in other area's but I just can't seem to put the muscle on I feel I deserve and it discourages me at some points. Any tips are warmly welcomed and highly appreciated. Thank you. \n\nPic of what I look like right now. http://imgur.com/zRz2a3d\n\nI'm 18 if that has anything to do with it.",
            "Hi guys!  \nSo, ive done a deload week and Im going to start of a phase/block/program were Im focusing on hypertrophy. I wanted yout opinions. Basically, the main lifts are done 4x6, with starting at 70% of 1RM and ramping up to 80%. On the last week, the last set is an AMRAP to see if any progress was made and/or set a new rep/volume PR. The next cycle I will increase starting weight with 2,5% ( or calculate new 1RM based on the AMRAPset) and start over. At the same time the sets/week of eaxh muscle group is increasing. Starting of with 12 sets per week and ending with 20. Im going to train each muscle 2x a week were i alternate between Squats/Front suats and Bench/ Incline bench for example. The variation of the main lift will be done in a higher rep range and progress will be made by adding weight when hitting rep goal, adding reps, slowing down the eccentric phase and so on. The extra sets wach week are added to the accesory lifts (an example for chest: Incline bench, Squeeze press) and also on isloation work that is very minimal at the start (like 2x15) or even adding an extra exersice for the muscle group. Before beginning a new cycle I will deload. Thanks ahead guys!",
            "I'm not an expert, but I'm under the impression programs like P90X were generally meant for cutting weight. If you're looking to add muscle mass and gain strength, I'd do more weight lifting. Bench press, curls, squats, that sort of thing. Low reps with higher weight, like 5 sets of 7 reps. Along those lines. Load up on the protein. ",
            "What I do is a 3x8 of 4-5 exercises and I do a different body part each day. After that I play like an hour of basketball. What I’ve found is that if I challenge myself hard enough on the weights, it is kinda like doing light cardio because of what my heart rate is at. Also gaining muscle will help you lose weight over the long run. The more muscle you have increases your basal metabolic rate which means you basically burn more calories while sedentary. Losing fat is a long process and it will require a lot of work. Basically what most people recommend to lose fat is to calculate your basal metabolic rate(you can find a calculator for that online) and subtract 5% from that. That way you are at a calorie deficit and it will be the most healthy way to lose weight. I also use some supplements such as creatine and L-citruline for muscle endurance and increased nitric oxide. Some people use preworkout but I don’t use it because it has an unhealthy amount of caffeine and I don’t wanna blow out my heart lol. What I do before workouts is drink a protein shake with some creatine and L citruline. If you are starting from scratch then you should probably have some sort of workout program you should follow. Again, losing fat is not something you will see in a week or a month, so don’t get discouraged. It will probably take at least a year to get a drastic change. The program that I’m on is more for strength, not really for big muscles or anything, so you should look into a program that fits your needs. Although fat loss is your main goal, maybe have some secondary goals just so you are hyped to go back to the gym, such as getting your bench press numbers up. Another option that you should look into is calisthenics, where the exercises are mostly body weight. I haven’t done this but many people look pretty ripped off of that. But yeah initially starting out you should focus on going like 60% emphasizing proper form(for squats, bench press, overhead press, deadlift, etc) for a couple weeks and then you do something called progressive overload where each time you go to the gym you either add more weight or more reps. The problem that I have is I don’t eat enough sometimes so my progression kinda stalls but if your on the heavier side of the scale I feel like that won’t be too much of a problem for you and doing something like that will benefit you more. If you want I can send you what I do when I go to the gym just as like a template. "

            "Hey everybody. I am a 6'2\" 175 16 yo. I am in shape, but my body definitely does not reflect that. Love handles are more than a bit visible. This has been my life the past couple of years, and I want to change it. I play lacrosse, which takes up a lot of my time, but conditioning doesn't happen often enough to make an impact. I try to go for runs during the summer, but I find myself making excuses. And my worst weakness is my overtendency to snack. I recently got my first girlfriend, and I don't want to feel embarrassed around her, so I'm finally trying to change for good. I have started doing nightly sets of crunches, but it's too early to see any results. I have a bench press and a chin up bar at my house. Any suggestions to help me would be wonderful. I thank you all in advance. \nMuch peace and love,\nJohn",
            "Friends - am someone who weighs 225 pounds, 31% body fat!! trying to get to 160 pounds and 15% body fat! Am doing resistance training as well as cardio. Till now, was doing full body workouts, but going to do dedicated muscle training from tomorrow. are machines good enough or should i do free weights? i dont have a trainer or a spotter. So bench press is tough. Can i get the same effect on chest press machines for example? ",
            "Sure, I'd be happy to elaborate. \n\nBench press - works chest, triceps (back of your arms), and shoulders slightly. The closer together your hands are, the more it works triceps. The farther apart your hands are, the more it works chest. The entire action will work the stability of your shoulders so its always best to warm up shoulders before doing bench press. Push-ups will also work these muscles, and engage your core/abs more. Make sure to keep your elbows closer to your body. It's natural to want to flare your arms out during bench press, but this will put too much stress on your shoulders and can injure you. \n\nDeadlifts - works lower back, engages your core/abs, and can also work hamstrings/glutes (butt) depending upon how straight your legs are. Keep your back arched here, and don't let your knees stray out over your toes. A non-arched back can quickly cause back injury and make you have a sore back for weeks. \n\nSquats - works all parts of your legs (hamstrings, quads) and glutes. Also can put some strain on your back, so its important to keep correct form. Keep most of the weight on your heels, NOT YOUR TOES. Keeping the weight over your toes will put stress on your knees. Imagine sitting back in a chair as you take the weight down. Arched back here as well. Use a smith machine (the rack with the bar that is attached and slides up and down) since you are new. \n\nPull-ups - works back muscles and biceps slightly. Very tough at first, but great for building strength. \n\nDips - triceps, chest, shoulder stability. Chest up works your triceps more, leaning over with your chest facing the floor works your chest more. \n\nLeg lifts will help work those tough to get lower abs. \n\nAgain, if you want to see max results, eating right is key. This website will help calculate calories you need to gain/lose weight, depending on what you want. \n\nhttp://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm\n\nAlso, since you're 15, you're still growing so you don't want to hurt yourself and stunt your growth. Keeping the weight lighter will help you grow without hurting your bones/joints. Stay with lighter weights and switch up your reps from 10 to 15 to 20 on different weeks. I wouldn't recommend using any weight that you can't lift more than 10 times. After a few weeks you should see major improvement in strength. Eating right will help you see visual improvements quicker. \n\nAlso, stretch the muscles you just worked after your workout! Stretching will improve your recovery time and even help a young body like yours grow taller and stronger. \n\nhttp://www.bodybuilding.com/ has tons and tons of articles on proper nutrition and lots of workout samples. ",
            "Try to find a beginner strength program online and familiarize yourself with basic compound movements such as the bench press, squats, deadlifts, pull-ups, shoulder press and many more. Always practice good form to prevent unnecessary injuries, even if it means practicing with no weight on the bar. I recommend you to check out Athlean-X on youtube for more help. If it were up to me, i'd tell you to eat at your maintenance level of calories while also taking in about 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight. This will ensure that your muscles get enough protein in while also helping you lose fat. \n\nCheck the links below for more help\n\n[Beginner Strength Program](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-routines/complete-mf-beginners-training-guide-plan) \n\n[Athlean X Youtube Channel](https://m.youtube.com/athleanx?uid=e0TLA0EsQbE-MjuHXevj2A) "

            "Hi! I’m looking for some advice (or direction to another post) on my current workout routine. Currently I strength train M-F, different muscle groups each day (chest, bis/tris, legs, back, shoulders). I also incorporate HIIT, yoga and plyometrics.\n\nI’m wondering if this is a good set up. Should I be working muscle groups more than once a week like 2 upper body 2 lower body 1 full body day kinda thing? \n\nAny advice is appreciated!!! ",
            "First, don't forget your legs.  \n  \nTo increase upper body muscle mass, you probably want to focus on lats, traps, chest and shoulders. My own main focus is on these, but not chest.  \nI recommend you do horizontal and vertical pushing and pulling for structural balance. Pullups are vertical pulls, rowing is horizontal pulling. Dips and overhead presses for the pressing motions. Basically, most upper body muscle mass is centered around the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. If you do an exercise that moves your shoulders forward, back, up and down, under load, this should work nicely.  \nIf you don't have weights available you can still do these, with the exception of overhead presses. You can try working up to handstand pushups to substitute.  \nCompound (using several muscle groups in unison) exercises are the best at packing on muscle fast. You should definitely do some deadlifts eventually to build your back.",
            "A lot of variations of leg lifts on a crossbeam for your core strength. Upper body has a lot of different muscle groups and it is hard to build their strengths without any free weights.

Think about it like this equation:\nHypertrophy (increase in muscle size)=Time under tension\n\nIf you are working without weights then you are unable to increase the tension by adding resistance. This means you need to add time by doing your reps slower/resting less/doing more reps. You can also increase tension by choosing progressively difficult variations of a given exercise to make it more difficult as you go. For example you can start with push-ups with your hands on an elevated surface. Then move to traditional push-ups. Then try with just one foot on the floor. Then go to two feet with one arm. "

Not constant, and just when I pushing up ill feel a little shot or two of tingle go down my arm. Should I opt for lifting instead?",

            "I started working out in late 2013, at age 26 when I weighed only 55 kg, with about 4% bodyfat. A friend recommended me the Runtastic Push-Up App. So I did that and managed to do loads of push-ups from the get-go. I peaked at 120 in one go in early 2014. Managed to get up to 65 kg (10% bodyfat) within a few months without focusing on nutrition. Kept on doing about 1000-1500 push-ups a month up to June 2015, when I did 3000-something. What I noticed was that even though I keep doing them without taking long breaks I started to struggle doing as many at once (per set) as I once did. \n\nI decided to join a gym last September. I've added doing leg, arm and core exercises on the machines 3 times a week for 40-60 mins. and investing in whey supplements. Even though I increased weights steadily and focused on eating loads constantly, I only managed to gain 1 kg of muscle mass in 9 months (had a serious flu for one of them).\n\nNow what's worse is, that with every passing month my body seems to age more rapidly when it comes to recovery periods. Stagnating gains, increasing pains. Whereas I would usually just need 2-5 minute warm-ups without feeling muscle aches for more than half a day the next day. Now I do 10 minute warm-ups and the pains even from only doing 75 push-ups last for three days. I feel like wreck. Even when I don't train for a week, the moment I get up in the morning my body feels exhausted. Even sitting upright for a long while aches. Due to the longer and longer breaks I turned that hard-earned muscle mass kilogram into a fat kilogram (just had a body consistency check-up).  \n\nI have no idea how I developed into this? Thinking about going to a doctor, but I don't want painkillers to cover up the symptoms. Where could this change in health stem from? Any suggestions and imput are very appreciated.",

I mainly do running on the spot (which at first, only lasted around ten minutes before I feel some pain in my kindey area, but now I can last about 17-18 minutes before feeling that pain). I did some Bodyweight Squats (20 per exercise), Crunches (25 per exercise, sometimes less cause it is very tiring), Push-Ups (15 tops, my arms are quite weak I think) and some Lunges (20 per exercise). I think that my legs actually last longer than my arms. So I have these exercises about twice a week, should I do them more? However, I usually feel some soreness on my muscles after these exercises and I normally don't feel like up to doing more until 3 or more days. Oh and any tips on how to increase my endurance on my arms?\n\nAlso, I read that if you do push-ups, you're really training your chest muscles, but I never feel tired on my chest part. My arms, on the other hand, feel really really exhausted just by doing mere 5 times of it and I usually have to rest around 10 secs before being able to continue.\n\nI eat a lot of fatty foods (I know, it is bad), by fatty foods, I mean a lot of fried or grilled foods.

            "Soccer player here\nAs far as conditioning goes, you can do a lot with just the field. A really simple running workout is to divide the outside of the field into six sections (end line to midfield, midfield to end line, sideline to sideline, end line to midfield, etc.) and start by sprinting one section and jogging five, then sprinting two sections and jogging four, all the way until you are sprinting all six sections. This will get your stamina and sprint speed up while getting you used to actively resting (while jogging). The only strength exercise that I have done specifically for soccer is a push-up ladder that is kind of hard to explain but I'll do my best. Do one push-up, immediately followed by one shoulder press (no weight, just lift your arms over your head as if you are lifting two Dumbbells). Then do two push-ups and two shoulder pressed, and continue until you do ten push-ups followed by ten shoulder presses, then work your way back down to one. Both of these are designed so that you could do the exercises on a soccer pitch. If you do at least ten minutes of conditioning during your normal soccer training and try and run at least 5-6 times per week you should get a lot more fit, and try doing the push-up ladder as much as you can (or just work your way up to it-I had to try a few times before I could do the whole thing).

I asked anyone I knew for advice and made myself a plan for the training and, since I´m no fan of counting calories, started looking more onto what I was eating. \n\nSo, now the actual question/problem. In the plan I worked out, Push Ups are included. But my problem is, that after a few push ups my left shoulder starts aching. Sometimes it doesn´t even go away after a day. It didn´t use to be this way, I actually made lots of progress. Now, I already let various sports teachers and/or mentors look over my execution, body position etc. and they say it´s all fine. But why then does my shoulder always start aching?\n\nWell Reddit, if you are able to answer my question, i´ll give you an intergalactically delicious cookie :)",
            "First off, awesome for you to start working out and having the desire to get fit!  Running in place is a good start (but I'm sure pretty boring).  Jump rope would definitely give you the same cardiovascular benefits as well as give you a change of pace.  Plus, there are plenty of variations of jump rope to keep it  fresh (side to sides, front to backs, single leg hops, high knees, etc).  \n\nAs a beginner still, I would think you could work out 3 or 4 times a week.  I usually alternate between strength days and cardio days.  Switching your training days to this type of cycle will help with not feeling too sore to work out after a days rest.  Saving the push ups, squats, crunches, etc all for your strength days will still give you 2-3 days to recover from most of your muscle soreness.  Not to mention that cardiovascular activity actually helps reduce soreness inbetween your strength sessions (I always heard, and agree from experience, that steady cardio flushes out lactic acid build up - the body's byproduct of muscle metabolism that causes soreness in your muscles) .  \n\nAs far as push-ups not activating your chest muscles, I would be sure to retract your shoulder blades while you doing the movement (pulling your shoulder blades back trying to make them touch).  This would reduce the shoulder involvement during pushups and isolate your chest more.\n\nI hope this all helps and good luck!\n",
            "It all depends, there are different types of push ups each one helps build different muscles here is a web sight https://blog.mapmyrun.com/10-pushup-variations-build-entire-body/ \n\nBut hard core military push ups I would go cheat wide or shoulder wide as long as your butt isn't sagging to the ground or to high you want it online with your body."

Whether you’re sick, sore, exhausted, frustrated, bad day at the job, or family issues, WHATEVER brings you down, don’t skip a day. Don’t do it. Set yourself a “rainy day” workout. So on those days say maybe you’ll do 25 push-ups, or 3 sets of X workout no matter the reps or weight. \n\nSkipping days creates a bad habit and a hurts your dedication and motivation. Consistency is key, so even if you don’t get through the whole RR if that’s what you decide to do, you at least did SOMETHING and that’s gonna help build routine, and that will help you get to where you want to be."

            "If you are limited to home and few weights, I would do a lot of pushups.  Not just your standard either.  You don't want to focus on just your chest either.  Make sure to do your triceps and biceps as well, and your back if possible.\n\nFor pushups, there are a lot of styles.  Standard, wide 'grip', diamond hands, inclined (hands higher than feet), declided (feet higher than hands).  You can also look at some other types such as spider push ups, scorpion pushups.  If you can, get a medicine ball or box and alternate.  One hand on the box, one on the ground, then after one push up, switch without standing up.\n\nFor triceps, you can do a standard dip by putting your hands on a chair and your feet on another chair, or couch, then lowering and raising your body.\n\nIf you don't have weights, you can do curls with anything that has weight and will fit in your hand.\n\nBack is a little tougher.  I would try to get a pull up bar and start trying pull/chin ups.  You can also do rows with a heavy box or something of that type.\n\nThose are all good 'weightless' exercises you can do at home with little investment.  Just remember not to just do chest.

            "A bench and barbells with weight plates is a very good place to start and you could also add bodyweight exercises to help things along: I started with dumbbells and some small plates.\n\nIf you're a beginner or nearly a beginner, you don't have to worry too much about an overly refined plan: in fact, this is probably a good time to learn about your strengths and weaknesses and what sort of lifts you do well with.  This is pretty broad but you might like to do a basic push-pull-legs split.  Not sure how familiar you are, but that loosely means you work chest-triceps-shoulders (push motions) one day; back and biceps (pull motions) another day; and leg exercises on another day.  If you're up for it, that means you can work each muscles/muscle group twice a week, which will give you a rounded workout and make sure you're not overworking any one muscle group.\n\nIf I understand where you're at correctly, at this point one of the biggest things will be sheer consistency. At the beginning of trying to get back into shape, I noodled around with weights a couple of times a week. Even that helped since I was starting from zero, but now I exercise/lift six days a week and the gains are exponential.\n\nThere are also a ton of YouTube videos out there talking about different plans and demonstrating proper form on lots of exercises.

You're always faced with the scenario that there will be way more fit people around you, and looking good in their skin tight clothes, EVEN WHEN THEY'RE RUNNING! This automatically makes you feel uncomfortable, and may even prevent you from using certain machines because you don't want them to see you and judge you based on your appearance. First of all, you're going to the gym so you shouldn't care what people think about you because YOU'RE THERE! You didn't come up with another excuse as to why you needed to skip out on the gym and you made it happen! Even though that is sometimes a huge step because the media makes everyone feel bad about themselves, you ignored it. What if though you showed up to the gym already feeling confident because of the cute workout clothes you bought? I know that when I leave the house in a new outfit that I feel is \"on point\" I radiate an amazing positive energy! \n\nVanora Designs strives to create apparel that has you going anywhere feeling comfortable AND confident.

            "**My entire body feels sore, now what?**\n\nAnd so, particularly when it comes to people who are at the beginning of their freshly planned workout routines, sore legs and/or arms will absolutely wager a factor. Whenever you feel painful you kind of need to analyze on your own regarding the amount of \"ache\" you are dealing with. Regardless, aim to hold off the craving of taking a seat for extended periods of times when you feel marginal to medium amounts of discomfort.\n\nAlternatively, do a light workout and keep your body engaged.\n\nIn case you experience extreme pain and/or soreness, it should be considered to be a good indication that your body is informing you that you should tone down your workout plan and you've forced yourself too far.

Choose the one you want depending on your physical result wishes.\n\nHaving said that, what we do like to state here at light &amp; leaf is that we prefer to choose both. There are a multitude of workout routines (think HIIT) which incorporates both muscle building and endurance to acquire both results simultaneously, and the majority of people like the results of both of these.\n\n**Heart rate zones? Is there a zone that should be targeting?**\n\nQuick answer: Yes. Long answer: Not really.\n\nBetween the elite sportsmen in addition to endurance runners (which we are supposing the majority of our audiences typically aren't), heart rate zones are checked intensively as they are wanting to improve their career. As far as we go is attempting to trigger the \"Afterburner Effect\"; the effect of your body burning calories well after your workout has been finished. If you want to reach this effect, you have to push your heart rate high enough by carrying out physical exercises such as cycling, using the elliptical, rowing, weight lifting or the good old sprinting.\n\nNaturally, doing any of the exercise routines would be hard to do without the proper workout gear and therefore we 'd like to redirect your attention to our website (**click** [here](https://www.lightleaf.store)) to find a great selection of choices that focuses on performance as well as a fashion edge that will rock your world.\n\nLet us know how you feel about these tips by leaving a comment below.",

Cardio is mandatory - after a couple weeks of cardio *every* day you won't even need motivation.\n\nThen diet... Aah the most difficult thing to manage lol.  What I do is purchase Wasa crackers/bread packs that are reasonably priced (2 for 5$) and use good quality peanut butter on them (around 3$) and it will last my munchies AND lunch for a couple weeks.  Then you can get pita bread and hummus, some rice or quinoa, which can stretch the budget a bit but it is really high protein! Oh! and stock up on yogurt when it's on sale!  Yogurt saves my life when I get sweet cravings!  Then there's also those 5 calorie snack pack jellos that help in sweet cravings!\n\nTHEN while you do all of this you should also focus on becoming toned, so go on YouTube and find Pilates or yoga videos that will help you enhance your muscles.  Plus the more muscle you have the more calories you burn'\n\nI honestly can't give you a routine because everyone is different and I'm no trainer but I can say do about 30-40 min cardio, and pilates/yoga till you die and eat right, then repeat the next day - no days off.

            "Pushups are actually rather hard, because you need a lot of Body control. \n\nBut here it goes: think of yourself as of a plank. You take the Share of a slight upwards v with your feet being the highes point, your shoulders the highest and your ass a little bit higher than if you would be a straight line, but lower than your shoulders. Feet are 10-20cm apart. Your Arms should be a little wider than your shoulderspan. \n\nAs soon as you feel comfortable with the Position you go down. Pull the elbows to your Ribcage and in the beginning stop as soon as your elbows contact your ribcage. If that is too easy for you Touch the Folie with your nosetip. \n\nNow since you are down comes the hard Part. Only use your Arms to push you up, keep in Control of your Body, don't Break your form. Push, and if you are up, repeat. Keep checking your body. Stay in control. \n\nExpect 5-20 on the first try depending how fit you are. But just try it out. If you start with less it isn't a bad sign. It is what you make. ",
            "With those exercises, there's pretty much an unlimited amount of ways that one can go about doing them. Adding a rep per day works quite well. One of my favorite ways to use for body weight movements like these(minus the curls) is what is called EMOM, which a stands for Every Minute On the Minute. You start a stopwatch from 0:00, for the start of that minute, you do an exercise for however many reps you like. The remainder of that minute will be your rest. At the start of the next minute, you'll do the same for another exercise, so on and so forth. \n\nSay you want to work upper body on Monday using EMOM. We'll use 3 movements for example:\n1. Push-ups \n2. Curls\n3. Dips (using a chair)\n\nStart a timer at 0:00. Let's say we want to do 5 reps for each exercise. The first minute, I'll do 5 push-ups, rest the remainder of that minute. The 2nd minute, I'll do 5 curls and rest the remainder of that minute, and the 3rd minute I'll do the same for dips. Once you've completed each exercise for the 3 minutes, do it over again. \n\nThis is a great format for exercise and can be used in numerous ways to benefit anyone. \n\nBy looking at the exercises you have already been doing, here is an example routine that I might use: (This is just my opinion, I'm not telling you to just drop everything and do this alone, but I'm trying to give some knowledge that I've learned from years of lifting)\n\nMonday: Upper Body EMOM\n1st min: Push-ups x5-8\n2nd min: Curls x5-8\n3rd min: Dips x5-8\n\n^^^ This is Round 1. Do 3 to 5 rounds. Which would be 9 to 15 minutes long depending on how many rounds.\n\nTuesday: Core EMOM\n1st min: Crunches x8-12\n2nd min: Plank 30 sec.\n3rd min: Side plank (Right) 30 sec.\n4th min: Side plank (Left) 30 sec.\n\n^^^ That's round 1. Do 2 to 4 rounds. Which would be 8 to 16 minutes depending on how many rounds.\n\nWednesday: Lower body EMOM\n1st min: Squats x5-10\n2nd min: Lunges x5-10 (each side)\n3rd min: Wall sit 30 sec.\n\n^^^ That's round 1. Do 3 to 5 rounds which would 9 to 15 minutes depending on how many rounds.\n\nThursday: Same as Monday\nFriday: Same as Tuesday\nSaturday: Same as Wednesday \n\n** There are many other ways to choose which days to do these on but this is my preferred favorite. I always like to work the same muscle twice a week to get the best of it. Say you wanted to work the muscles once a week, then you could use something like this:\n\nMonday: Upper body EMOM\nWednesday: Core EMOM\nFriday: Lower body EMOM\n\nThis is just some of my ideas and opinions of what I like to do in these kind of situations. I hope you gained something from this and best of luck to ya! God bless!"

I understand that back also works out biceps, and same with chest and triceps, which is what I was going for, but would it affect me negatively in anyway if I were to do all those muscle groups in one day?

Push pull programs or upper lower, even a full body 3 times a week will all do the same ",

Push\\-ups are great but some inverted rows , pull ups , pike push\\-ups  will bring balance and better results in your upper body exercise . Combining pushing and pulling movements is a very good training technique in my opinion . Maybe you can try some lunge variations and hip thrust that are great exercises for your lower body .   "

But, I need help planning my workouts! I plan to workout 5 days a week and have 2 off days.\n\nI plan to do, chest, back and shoulders, legs, arms, and then either legs/arms or chest/back/shoulders. Or maybe I'll split back and shoulders into two days by themselves?\n\nI start every workout with cardio and abs\n\nChest Day:\n- Incline Bench \n- Regular Bench\n- Decline Bench \n- Flys? Any suggestions here? Curls?\n\nArm day suggestions?\n\nLeg day suggestions?\n\nBack and Shoulder Suggestions?",
            "Sounds like you’re not pushing your chest out on the bench before you lift. Bring your shoulder blades together. That’s proper form to focus the exercise. ",
            "I think diet is very important so definitely focus on that. Eat high calorie and maintain high calorie depending on your weight. Probably around a 2.5k calorie diet to put on weight. make sure the meals are composed of high in protein \\(chicken, steak, cheese\\) and carbs \\(usually early on in the day and slowly less as the day continues so that you don't have excess carbs that can turn into fat if not used\\). Monitor your weight and stay hydrated;\n\nNow for exercise, my workout for chest is part of my \"Chest and Tri's\" day. So i would start off will warming up with the bench with just the bar and working slowly up to your \"working weight\" \\(working weight you should be able to do 4 sets of 6\\-8 reps; if you cant reach that goal, LOWER THE WEIGHT\\) and after flat bench, incline bench with dumb bells or incline bench. do the same but lower the weight from flat bench because it is harder and probably a bit fatigued after flat bench. Do some machine chest workouts for decline if your gym has and move onto cable fly's. For cable fly's, it is hard to maintain form esp. if youre a beginner. If the form isn't on par, then do the machine flies for chest \\(4 sets of 10 take it slow and flex\\).\n\nAfter all the chest workouts, THEN I would tire out my triceps. I don't like doing triceps between chest workout because if your triceps are tired, it would be profoundly harder for you to continue with chest workouts. Tricep workouts would include rope triceps, straight or V bar triceps, skull crushers, push ups, close grip bench. try to stick with a high volume \\(higher amount of reps 10\\-12\\) to tone a build muscle. \n\nWhen you first start gyming, Consistency with diet and workouts is the key to gain muscle. PLEASE WATCH YOUR FORM, don't hurt yourself. by focusing on form when you first start gyming, you develop a good framework for the future and lower your risk of injury. one injury can affect you for a lifetime so becareful. Always have a spotter if possible."

            "There's one I like called prime the pump, pretty old and hard to find it on the posts exactly what it is as far as which exercise for how many reps and so forth. But the jest of it is, have a drop set in the middle of your routine and super set of a large muscle with a concentration  move on your last set of every body part. \n\nBut now that your done with today's workout, you need to do all of the exercises you have planned for tomorrow for one set of 30. Your 30th should be at or near failure if your not there keep going till you fail. \n\nSo example, Monday is rest day Tuesday is chest/tri, Wednesday back/bis \n\nMonday do chest exercises 1 set 30 times\n\nTuesday do normal chest then back 30 times\n\nWednesday do normal back then Thursday workout 1 set each 30 reps\n\nThis breaks down all your easy to tear muscle fibers and leaves way for incredible gains during tomorrow's work out\n\nAlways remember it's about blood flow to the muscle and how well you lift, so do good reps varying weights.... Don't just lift 6-8 every set. You need some 12-15's to move blood in and out of your muscle "

            "This isn't too far off of my chest/tri days (I have two a week).  I try to focus on each of the heads of the chest in separate workouts.  For instance, day one, sternal head, so that means flat bench, db flat bench, cable fly in a horizontal plane, push ups, etc (each exercise 4-5 sets, 8-12 rep range).  Day 2 hits the clavicle head, so incline bench, incline db press, cable flys from low to high, db pullovers, etc.  Same set rep range as previous day.  I also start my chest with a warmup exercise, a low weight cable fly in the opposite plane as what my main for the day is usually gets everything primed.\n\nMy tri work is broken up similarly, focusing one day on down pressing motions (rope push downs, one arm cable pressdown, dips) and one day on upward pressing motions (ovh extensions, skullcrushers, etc).     4-5 exercises, 4-5 sets, 8-12 reps.  If i am working sternal head chest, I work upward pressing tri movements.  For clavical head, I do downpressing tri motions.\n\nGood luck.\n"

If doing chest and triceps do cable flys, do tricep pull downs with a rope, then maybe hit some incline dumbbells to hit the top of your chest.

It is hard to understand your problem without seeing you live. Perhaps genetically you have lot of fat in the chest area, so maybe you need to reduce your total body fat percent. Anyway you will not change the form that is given to you by nature, so you need to work on the overall proportions of the body. ",

Get your flat bench numbers up, find a weight u can go till 12 reps and fail, and then train for strength with a heavy weight that you can only just do 5 or 6 reps with. Practice dips. Flies on cables or machine or dumbbells are really crucial too. Dumbbell pullover will help your chest. Eat extortionate amounts of food. Get rest. eat carbs before you workout"

            "A couple months ago I started working out with a close friend of mine who was fairly new to working out at a gym. Right before my set a guy walked up to us and asked if one of us could spot him so I looked at my friend and told him to go spot him. They guy was doing dumbbell press on a flat bench and my friend had no idea how to spot him properly, just that he needs to be there in case shit goes down. The guy gets the weights up on his own and lays down on the bench. Instead of kneeling down behind him to push his elbows and spot him, he kind of crouched to the side and hovered over the guy on the bench. I think this was the guys last set and he was maxed out so he needed help. He yelled to my friend \"Get it! Get it!\" So my friend kind of stands up and puts his hands on the dumbbells right above the guys hands and tries to pull them off. At this point the guy is really confused, mad, and cant hold up the dumbbells anymore so he ends up tossing them as my friend runs off to the side to avoid getting hit by the dumbbells. I ended up taking over and showed him how to properly spot someone!",

You want to focus on either of these the most as it works all 3 parts of your pectoral muscles. 3-4 sets of 6-8 reps.\n\n- Incline Bench OR incline dumbbell press (Again, pick one). 2-3 sets of 6-8 reps.\n- Decline bench OR decline dumbbell press (same as incline). \nPersonally I like to use dumbbells then bench, but do what you are most comfortable with\n\n**MOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR WORKOUT**\n- Cardio. This is what is going to burn that fat off. I would start off 30 mins of the Arc training or Elliptical. Do Cardio after your weight lifting session. \n\nTake it slow first. Work out your chest once or twice a week. Try and do cardio every other day. Remember, Form &gt; Weight. Stretch and warm-up before lifting.  \n\nI am not a certified personal trainer nor am I responsable for any injuries may accrue if you do decide to take my advice.\n\nAsk any questions if you have them :)\n\nEDIT: I would suggest just working out in general, not only your chest!"

Monday: Legs and shoulders(Weird I know)\nTuesday: Cardio in the form of school sports\nWednesday: Chest and triceps\nThursday: Back and biceps\nFriday: School sports\nSat: Break\nSun: Abs\n\nI'm not sure if you want the specifics like the weight I carry and reps I do but I usually just aim for 6 sets, max out reps every set. With a rest time of 1-2 mins\n\n2. Actually I live in Singapore, whereby ee adopt an Asian food culture, so we consume a lot of carbs.\n\nBreakfast usually starts off with bread with egg mayo. Brunch is chicken macaroni. Lunch is any form of meat rice. Dinner is just rice again. In between, I would eat some more stuff also.\n\nFor protein, I would just eat 4 hardboiled eggs at the end of the day along with drinking milk daily.\n\nWith that I calculated about 2200kcal per day.\n\n",
            "If you want fast answer for beginner then it is 6-10 reps in 4 sets (30-40 sec set) , 4-5 exercises per workout day, 3-4 times a week. \n\nFor example:\n\nMonday: Legs/Shoulders \n\nWednesday: Back/Chest\n\nFriday:Arms/Posterior Deltoid\n\nSaturday: Complex movements like snatches, jerks + some for Chest for example to force this muscle group from the beginning.\nGood Luck!",
            "Well my friend, I personally prefer to workout different muscle groups on different days. I am doing shoulders and legs as we speak, tomorrow will be Bicep and back for a solid Pull Day, and the following day will be chest and triceps for a Push Day. Then a break, and repeat. \n\nThe most important thing to remember is diet is 75% of transformation. High protein, high carb, low fat. That's how I am lean bulking without tacking on fat. I will then do a mild low calorie cut to remove any excess fat.\n\nIf you want my EXACT workout, I'll be more than happy to oblige.",
            "Keep it simple, sounds like you need bulk up if you want to get bigger. More weight, more food as you will need energy. Google tdee and that will let you know what your calorie intake needs to be to gain mass while working out, protein and being consistent needs to be a big priority as well. My workout routine is Day 1: chest, triceps and shoulders. Day 2: back, biceps and traps. Day 3 is legs. Day 4/5 cardio (as I’m trying to cut weight while not losing mass) mix in abs throughout. I am by no means an expert but have had good results so far with this, im just trying to keep it simple. Also when I feel ok plateauing I’ll switch my routine up from heavy weights 4 sets of 8-10 reps to lighter weight but more reps. Lifting heavy builds muscle and mass and more reps creates strength and endurance. Hope this helps!"

Second, change up the exercises, there are a lot of different ones that aren't overhead press that aren't as demanding on your joints. Third, for now take an over the counter antiinflammatory. After a few weeks see if it goes away. If not get in for at least an x-ray asap you can REALLY permanently fuck up your joints because our bodies aren't meant to lift extremely heavy weights on our joints. Took me years of changing up HOW I worked out and learning the science behind each movement before I could lift comfortably without joint pain again. GL to you!"

Do cardio after lifting. You do cardio after lifting to burn more calories, I forget specific details on why. For cardio I would say jog for 20 minutes. Or do interval training. Depends on goals. Hope this helps.",
            "Well, my best advice would be this: for about one to two weeks, do pushups and situps at home. Start with 20 reps each set and get in three sets a day. Every day, increase pushups by 2 and situps by 5 until failure. Challenge yourself. After this, find a friend that has been going to the gym for a while and ask if you can workout with them. Work with them for about a month and then tweak their workout to your preferences. An example of what a week of working out might look something like this: Monday-Chest. Tuesday-Biceps and Triceps.  Wednesday-Back. Thursday-Shoulders. Friday-Legs. Some Chest exercises would be bench press(normal, incline, and decline) and flys. Some bicep and tricep exercises would be curls(bar or dumbbells are fine) and skullcrushers. Some back exercises would be rows(machine are dumbbells) and t bar pulls. Some shoulder exercises would be military press and lateral raises. Lastly, some leg exercises would be squats and leg press. Keep in mind that this is just an example and that it doesn't have to be like this. Missing a workout is not terrible if you aren't missing workouts twice or more times a week, but make sure to never stop lifting for more than two weeks at a time if you absolutely must. Happy lifting!",
            "Dumbbell presses are the best in my opinion. Start with flat bench, then incline, then decline. The difference is you press up starting wider than shoulders but finish the move with your hands directly over your chest. That squeezing motion is key. \n\nSets:\nChoose a weight you can press 12 times for the first set. Count slowly, 2 seconds up and 2 seconds down. Rest for 2 or 3 minutes to allow the blood to rush to your chest. Move up 5lbs for the second (rest) and third set of  12 reps. Rest. Go back to the original weight for the 4th set. \n\nThis is a combination of weight lifting and time lifting. Finding the balance between how much you can lift (in good form) for over 45 seconds for each set of 12 reps. \n\nSimply, 4 seconds per rep x 12 reps = 48 seconds \n\nI guarantee you’ll feel it within a day or so after doing this. ",
            "Yes. It's simple. Eat lean and mean. Lift heavy and short. Think white meat chicken and spinach, 4 set of 8-10 reps  of the most weight you can lift with good form at those reps. Don't do regular cardio maybe 1x per week. Eat 2500 calories per day and increase that by 100 cals per week til you're at 3000 cals then increase by 100 cals per month. Lift atleast 2-3x per week. Include bench press, deadlifts, and other compound exercises.",
            "From what I heard doing cardio (and also burpees) burns a lot of fat. I don’t know from experience because I’ve always been lean and don’t need less body fat. If you want to build a nice chest you can do a bunch of push-ups, bench press, cable cross over, ect. As far as abs go, everyone has them but you won’t get them to show unless you lower your body fat level.\nMy workout schedule was Day 1: legs/abs - Day 2: Chest/triceps - Day 3: High intensity Cardio - Day 4: Back/Bicep/Abs - Day 5: Shoulders/Calves/Forearms/Cardio.",
            "So, I'm assuming you're already working on your diet plan, if not, definitely need to do that first, if you're wanting to cut.\n\nSo, general advice is, low weight, high reps. The best way to start is to find out your maxes, and set your workout to be 3 sets of 12 reps at about 60 - 65% of your max.\n\nHere's a pretty simple starting point:\n\n*Monday: Back/Shoulder Day\n-Lat Pulldowns(or Pullups, if you can rep those)\n-Overhead Press\n-Seated Rows\n-Front Raises\n-Back Flys\n-Upright Rows\n-Lawnmowers\n-Shrugs\n\n*Tuesday: Leg Day\n-Squaaaaaaats!\n-Calf Raises\n-Hamstring Curls\n-Inductor/Adductor machine\n\n*Wednesday: Chest Day\n-Bench Press\n-Incline Bench Press\n-Decline Bench Press\n-Chest Flys\n-Pullovers\n\n*Thursday: Core Day\nIf core is your focus, you should know how you're wanting to work it, if not, do some research, and figure out what's going to work best for you, but make sure to hit all the areas. I would recommend watching Athlean X on YouTube, he has some amazing videos, and not just for core, but everything.\n\n*Friday: Arm Day\n-Preacher Curls\n-Nosebreakers (AKA Skullcrushers)\n-Farmers Walk\n-Hammer Curls\n-Tricep Overhead Extension\n-Wrist Flexion/Extension\n\nPlenty of work you could do adding to/subtracting from this setup, but it's a really good jumping off point, and can work the way it is, if you want.\n\nEdit: Attempting to fix phone formatting"

My back feels ten times worse, and my 'bum muscles' burn, getting off the sofa is a nightmare! Have i been made to do something that i maybe shouldn't have been doing? I guess i thought there nay be more core work and less leg work, but i'm not an expert. Can anyone please help? Either with something alternative, or a reason that he would give me these things to do 3x a week?\nThanks so much!"

            "Hi, which different types of exercise did huntergathers do? And in which order did they do them? Do you think the same as if you would guess. I believe most of their days looked like this: 1. Wake up and get up 2. forage for animals such as deer, wild boars etc. by running with bow, knife and stalking(low intensity) animals to, when one is close enough, shoot it and kill it. then they would lift the animals over their shoulders and carry at back to camp. Maybe they would push heavy trees across rivers if they needed to avoid dangerous currents. If the animal got hurt and resisted by attacking(lets say far ranged ammo of arrows ran out) the hunter that guy would explosively hit and push of the animal.\n\nThey rarily moved in my opinion and when they did they had to due to glaciers, floods and vecause of climate overall. In the move and during the relocating process they carried heavy and light things long ways, because it is not like it was freezing in one square kilometer and tropic climate in the one next to it. Also, I think that the hunting only had sprinting involved if the scenario was similar to this: 1. hunter throws knife or shoots animal with last arrow, 2. animal gets hurt. 3.animal runs but slower and staggers 4. Hunter\\`s camp has no food and so he needs to take down this animal without arrow and to do this he must sprint if he for example hit a boar or deer in the leg or in the behind area.\n\nI would say they did this most of the time: First low intensity cardio(hunting by stalking the animal by walking slowly and quickly, often for a long time) and afterwards high intensity workout in the form of heavy lifting of the dead animal or explosive short sprint to take down wounded animals by hand.\n\nAnd when they moved camp, which was not any daily routine, I think they kind of did both high an dlow intensity at the same time, they carried camp belongings, food etc.(heavy lifting for men probably) and walked long distances without stopping but sometimes they still stopped to sleep, eat, drink and rest for some hours and this rest was prolonged by breakfast preparation and consumption.",

            "Hello everyone!\n\nI started going to the gym last week with no specific goal apart from forming a good habit to begin with. I am kind of “skinny fat”,  168cm, 62kg so I will probably want to get toned ultimately but for now, it’s more important to me that I keep doing it every day  no matter what. \n\nI cannot run properly as I broke my ankle (fibula) in the same spot 3 times and now I have metal plates in that place. They don’t hurt but I feel uncomfortable. Sooo my first question is this- instead of running, I do fast walking (6.5 mph) at an 15% incline. I do that for 20 minutes (plan is to add time every day until I reach 30mins). I am not feeling any pain in my legs- does this mean my walking has no effect? \n\nSame question for swimming- I used to swim “professionally” long time ago (I sucked but was doing it for years so at least, unlike with walking,  I am sure I got the technique right)- 30 mins of breast stroke and no signs of pain in my muscles. \n\nI am not an active person, 100% sedentary except walking dogs twice a day but that’s no workout, we live in a city.\n\nToday was my 3rd time at the gym, I imagined I would be in a lot of pain but nothing.. not that I am desperate to be in pain I am just worried that I am wasting my time and will end up having to get a personal trainer to show me how to do things properly. I would really like to avoid that. \n\nAny thoughts? Is 15% incline in any way “substituting” for the fact I am not actually running? Is there a way to make walking more intense? Maybe holding weights? Again, I don’t have a specific goal as of yet but I would not want to waste my time if my self determined “workouts” have no effect so just trying to get things right\n\nThank you! \n\n",

And, to be honest, I spend 90% of my time at home. My work is internet-based, so I'm very sedentary. I've considered joining a gym, but the closest one is at least a half hour away and really expensive, plus my work generally requires me to be at home and available all day and well into the night during the week.

I'm a thin guy with a little definition. Not completely skinny with no muscle. I've always wanted to work out and get into better shape. My job is physical and usually through that work up to 143lbs but get laid off (construction). It's always hard cause making back that 13 lbs in 2-2.5 months is painful. I'd like to just make it part of my lifestyle and go beyond my working weight and be able to maintain that. I quit smoking about 3 weeks ago and this time I feel as though it's the time and I've started eating way better etc. \n\nI've found that previous times that ive tried to workout I wouldn't have as much motivation and wasn't as serious. Id workout the first time really and push myself too far and would for instance not be able to lift my arm more than a few inchs without wincing. Mostly in the joint area between forearm and bicep. Maybe tendons or sore muscle? \n\nI just don't know where to start with beginner workouts that will give me slow enough yet quick enough progress to at least get my muscles in a happy place where they are actually ready to handle a workout. I don't want to try again and be out for days cause the pain is undoable. I understand there should be soreness.. that's why they say ripped etc but it has been extreme a few times and didn't end up going back. Any advice of workouts, weights and reps to start with.. signs I should watch for. And when I should feel comfortable to take the next step. I know I need to start somewhat slow but don't want to start lifting 5lbers ya know. I can do 20-25 for 10reps up to 4-5 sets from what I recall but that's where the issue lies. It feels okay at the time but not after. Sorry if the post is long and I appreciate your time and opinion. \n\nRight now I have body weight and dumbbells with weights, also was thinking of using a camping cooler as a bench with dumbbells for now. Want to start at home until I feel more confident and less distracted at gym and know what I need to do. Thanks again. \n",

Given that, I'd try peanut butter sandwitches in between meals. You need high mono and polyunsaturated fats and moderately high carbs. Throw some bananas or honey in there. I had this skinny client in college go from 150 soaking wet he started eating 2 pb sandwiches inbetween every meal 4-5 sandwiches a day on top of his normal food and given the correct way of lifting he gained a solid 15lbs over time (which for him was amazing). \n\nMake sure you stay away from those mass gainers they sell online...it's a waste of money and that type of calorie over time can cause some unpleasant long term affects.

Before i started using it i learned how to properly punch, if I could use it with or without gloves and how to do kicks. When i started i was hitting it soft so i get the hang of it (without gloves because i wanted to strengthen my wrist and knuckles). The first day i was fine, took a day of rest and then started again the next morning, the second time my wrist got really badly hurt, so i used the R.I.C.E method for my hands and i took 2 days without using a punching bag but i was still going to the gym, my wrist were hurting when i did curls. So i took days of the gym, almost a week past and i was getting annoyed that my wrist weren't healing fast enough, so i went to the gym one day at night (even though my hand still hurted) i started using the punching bag and i was ignoring the pain and when i finished my workout my hands actually felt better, idk how punching helped but It did. So my question is how did my knuckles get used to punching a heavy bag so fast even though i was a beginner and most people recommended to take it slow and start with gloves.

An exception is possible only in the case of Pharmacology using. \n85 kg and 15% fat is really possible till Dec 2017.  \n\nIf I were you I would focus on heavy athletic movements like snatches, jerks, deadlifts, front squats. Interval cardio 1-2 times a week and some walking on the fresh air will help in recovery and fat burning. \n\n 1,5g of protein, 1-1,2g of fat and 2g of carbs will be enough for your transformation beginning. Give your preference to non-refined products. It is also necessary to control your water balance. 2,5-3,5 sites will be enough. \n\nThe constant progression of the training load is the basic principle.

            "I can advise you training with kettlebells. First of all, learn how to perform kettlebell snatch. This exercise will help you develop explosive strength and endurance. It involves most large muscle groups and develops a neuromuscular connection between them. With this movement, you will also develop mobility of the waist, strengthen the knee and shoulder joints. \n\nThe second important movement for you is kettlebell swings. Here, the main emphasis will be on the back of the thigh and lower back. This movement perfectly develops the skills of jumping. \n\nKettlebell is a very convenient and less traumatic projectile than most other free weights. Kettlebell is an excellent alternative to classic dumbbells, with a lot of advantages. I recommend to try it personally in order to understand the effectiveness of training with weights. Good luck!",

You want the seat to be high enough that when your knee is as extended as possible there is still a slight bend in the knee.\n\nCould also be that you’re doing too much pushing and not enough pulling. You should be simultaneously pushing down with one foot and you pulling up with the other. This distributes the resistance evenly between the quads and hamstrings. Too much quad work can hurt your knees. \n\nCould be over training. Cycling is less impact than walking/running however you are still doing a lot of work at the knee joint.

            "For the most part the video was good. \n\nA few tidbits of feedback on why I wasn't in love with it:\n\n\nFirst, You talk and ramble to much. Its hard to focus on fixing my positions when there are no pauses in the speech, the first pause to allow me adjustment to suggestions is at 3 min. I would suggest telling us correct posture and then telling the biker story while im getting myself adjusted. \n\n\nSecond, Explain to me how I should do things either during or immeadetly after transition. E.G. at 1:30 you tell us we're starting seated, and you dont tell us how to sit until 2:15. Another example would be at 3:40 you tell us to stand up, and dont tell me how to stand up properly till about 5:15 when you give the 4 tips. With the fast paced videos, I was already standing by the time you told me how.\n\nThird, I would emphasise when transitioming between exercises. The amount of talking in the same tone kinda makes my mind relax. In the video you go \"all right, its time to stand up\" if you went more along with \"ALL RIGHT, its time to stand up\". This tip combined with the first tip means I can relax and adjust, when I hear the \"ALL RIGHT\" I can bring my full attention back to the video and move on. \n\nThank you for sharing these exercises!

            "I think you can make faster progress if you train antagonists in the same workout or make a more complex split. \nI also recommend alternating exercises. For example: you can make squats 3-4x6-12 then do some rod pull to the chin 3-4x8-12, after that romanian deadlift 3x6-8 then wiring with dumbbells 4x12 etc.\n\nIf we talk about 3 workouts a week, I would plan them as follows: Mon - Legs/Shoulder, Wed - Back/Chest, Fri - start with some complex movement like snatch then biceps/triceps. \n\nI hope this can be usefull. Good luck!"

I basically starved myself and exercised like a freak, 7days a week sometimes twice a day while eating 1500-2000 calories. This made me binge eat at some occasions and I felt guilty and starved myself more. I was down at 70kg.\n\nA year past and I decided to bulk because I was “free” from the disorder. 1 year eating clean, tracking macros past 4 months, small surplus, trying to progressively overload and get stronger... no results. I’ve tried my best and I’ve worked hard, and I’ve put in A LOT of effort without success. I really just wanna look good and aesthetic.\n\nI’m not gaining (visible) muscle, I’m barely getting stronger. I look fatter. I often feel tired, sad, depress and hopeless. The fat I’m gaining is almost all on stomach since I got veins and shit on thighs, arms etc. As a soon to be 18 male I got no facial hair, voice is not like a child’s voice but it’s not deep either. My frame is thin and I’m 190cm, 76,5kg, long legs, short torso with kind of wide/high/tall hip bones (runs in family).\n\nMy little brother got a deeper voice and almost looks manlier.

If you don't have a good diet of real food, the supplements won't do anything.\n\nIf you are trying to gain size, make sure you are getting enough calories with enough carbs and protein throughout the day from good sources (lean meats, healthy carbs, good fats etc...).  You can look up good diets online, but just to get you started \n\ngood proteins - fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs\n\ngood carbs - sweet potatoes, brown rice, oatmeal\n\ngood fats - flax seed oil, nuts, extra virgin olive oil\n\n\nPost workout it's important that you don't just get protein in, you also need some fast digesting sugary carbs mixed in with that protein.

            "Well what you have is the split and it looks good (or it is very likely good enough). \n\nHowever, this is only one part of a good program and probably not the most important part. \n\nI highly recommend watching Dr. Israetel’s intro to hypertrophy (he have intro video on YouTube under Revive Stronger podcast).\n\nThe first key is specificity - do you want strength or size. You mentioned hypertrophy so you are going with the latter; for size, the key is volume (weight x rep x set).  How munch volume are you doing? For beginner maybe start with 10 or 12 set a week per major muscle group (chest, lats, back, quads, glutes) and see how you do.\n\nThe second key missing element is overload. Are you doing heavy enough? Research shows the minimum effective load is anything above 60% of your one rep max (1RM).\n\nThe third key is progressive overload. You can just go bust your ass giving your max every time - it is subpar but not because the stimulus is too strong but because you cannot sustain long (it takes time to gain, though it is much faster for beginner). Also, it increases risk of injury. The best way is to do the minimum volume for you to grow but you add more (more weight, more reps, more sets or a combination) each week. (You absolutely must keep track of your workouts; take a notebook or use your phone) In this way you can milk the gains for weeks and weeks and you get stronger and bigger without burn out prematurely. You push a bit harder each week until you are near max or a bit beyond (overreach); then you deload for a week to reset, rest and recover. Usually this happens after 4-7 weeks of progressive overload when you have accumulated too much fatigue. Ppl say beginner can do longer but it depends on your starting volume, overload size, ongoing intensity, stress in life etc. I highly recommend research that too cos the GAINs come from rest and recovery. After this, you repeat the process and start a new mesocycle.\n\nAnother point is periodization. It is perhaps not relevant to you now but you can look into it. Basically muscles get used to stimulus over time and growth slows; one way to overcome is to change the stimulus a little after some time (say two cycles). You can change the exercise, the grip, the tempo etc. this is not key for your level now (Maybe after 6m you can try)\n\nFinally, nutrition. If you do the above correct, it would be a waste if you don’t take full advantage to grow by not taking enough calories and/or the right nutrients. For growth, you want to eat a bit more (say 300- 500 calories more each day) to fuel the growth. Don’t worry about fat. If you eat clean (no junk, refined carb or booze etc), you won’t put on much fat. Also, eat good quality protein (pp recommend 1g per lb of body weight); make sure at least half of your protein is from good source like meat/fish/dairy/protein powder. There are a lot of good resources online for nutrition during lean bulking. \n\nThis is what the pros recommend; online a lot of pp will tell you beginners can do anything and they will grow and it is true but you harvest more gains (and less risk of injury) by doing it proper and it also gives you better foundation to grow longer term. It is quite process driven and methodical. \n\nGood luck!\n",

Yes that's a good sign in this diet lmao. But if you can stick with it, it will shred body fat like a machine, but it's hard so you gotta stick with It!

Here's a starter article: \n\n[Will Cardio Keep Me from Gaining Muscle?]\n(http://www.menshealth.com/fitness/will-cardio-keep-me-from-gaining-muscle)\n\nI guess my general recommendation would be to try to get as much lean protein from your diet as is possible and convenient (though it sounds like you're a good candidate for PP all things considered).  I can't recommend creatine monohydrate (a very affordable amino acid (cheaper than even the cheapest PPs)) since I don't know much about how it might affect young people under 18, but many of us use it and it helps.  You definitely don't have to go crazy with supplements or even use them at all but PP, basic creatine monohydrate and BCAAs (sometimes, depending on your needs) are pretty standard/common.  Do you have a coach or team sports doctors who might be willing to sit down and talk with you about these things?  I think coaches (and team sports doctors) are the best resources since they know you and your specific needs as an athlete best."

Split routines are for those who have already accumulated significant muscle mass and for whom gains are difficult to come by (bodybuilders, etc.). While there's nothing wrong with a split routine (you will still see gains), it is more efficient to work out the body several times a week vs. working out the body over the course of two weeks, for example.

        "reddit_comments": [
            "Hey, Reddits! I'm getting kind of used to this thing now. I saw somebody else posted one of their blogs on here, and it seemed like it helped a lot of folks out. Thought I'd share one of my favorites, and something I feel like a large handful of you are struggling with: program design. These steps are recommended for somebody lifting 3-4 times a week (three times a week if full body workouts, 4 times a week if split body parts [lower/upper]). Let me know what you think! \n\n---------------------------------------------------\nA well-rounded training program should be like a hearty, home-cooked meal. Balanced, satisfying, and makes you feel pretty damn awesome. We're going to touch upon how each component to a good meal perfectly corresponds with each part of a well-designed training program.\n \n**MEAT = Strength.**\nThe \"meat\" of your program should be focused on STRENGTH. Equally important, you better eat that \"steak\" first when you're fresh and hungry. Work on compound movements in the lower rep range, with rest breaks between 2-3 minutes, more rest if necessary. Eating a big steak takes awhile to chew &amp; digest, so make sure you dedicate an equally good chunk of time to building your strength. No need to get overzealous with your exercise selection, or you may get indigestion; stick to one or two big movements and get really good at those first.\n \nExample: 5 x 5 back squats &amp; overhead press.\n \n**POTATOES = Accessory Lifts.**\nYour potatoes, rice, yams, or whatever other starch you like to eat with your meat is your delicious complimenting dish. We can compare your starchy side to any accessory lifts that help keep things balanced. Some general recommendations for accessory lifts may be glute exercises (bridges, hip thrusts, glute-ham raises, etc,) core exercises (plank, pallof press varieties, ab roll-outs, etc.), or perhaps some single-extremity training (lunges, one-arm bench press, single-leg romanian deadlifts, etc.) Accessory lifts may also be more \"bodybuilding\" in nature, such as bicep curls, tricep extensions, or hamstring curls. We know you can gobble up that scoop of mashed potatoes pretty quick, so comparably, your rest breaks will be shorter (30 seconds up to 2 minutes.)\n \nExample: 3-4 sets each x 8-12 reps of: dumbbell lunge, cable row, hip thrust, push-up.\n \n\n \n**VEGETABLES = Mobility.**\nVegetables may not have a huge direct impact on our physique, but they're full of all the nutrients that keep us healthy &amp; free of disease. We can compare the noble consumption of greens to doing the equally important deed of mobility work. Similar to eating your veggies, mobility isn't particularly fun or exciting. It's sort of just that \"thing\" you know you need to do in order to feel your best in the long-run. So eat your veggies, and do your mobility work.\n \nExample: 3 sets each x 10 reps of: dynamic lunge with reach, downward dog push-ups, deep squat, scapular wall slides.\n \n**DESSERT = Conditioning.**\nIf you're still hungry for more, feel free to finish your meal with a deliciously evil Metabolic Milkshake. Perfectly enough, your body usually hates you after a conditioning circuit just as much as it does after you finish off three pieces of that cheesecake. (And never eat cheesecake right BEFORE a conditioning workout, or you may be tasting it again in the most awful way.) A metabolic conditioning workout should be quick and dirty, and shouldn't take more than ten minutes. The secret is to go hard and go fast. Yes, just like what happens when you get your hands on that Ben &amp; Jerry's.\n \nExample: 30sec work/30sec rest kettlebell swings. Repeat 5-10x.\n \n**BOURBON ON THE ROCKS?**\nThis is your optional but highly recommended little \"cap\". It's relaxing, feels good, and makes the rest of your day a little bit better.Your bourbon is your physical activity of choice that brings you pleasure. Love skiing? Get out there and hit the slopes. Into running? Feel free, try the trails while you're at it &amp; soak up some sun. As long as these activities don't negatively impact your recovery, you're good to go.\n \nExample: 30-45min leisure bikeride.\n \nI hope this gives you a good idea on how to construct your own workout plan (or maybe even just your dinner tonight.) LETS EAT!"

            "I would defeat staying away from crunches and sit ups and stay with planks and maybe some leg raises or flutter kicks. I would suggest stretching. Almost everyone I know underrates it but especially as a beginner you can workout a sweat and start getting your body ready for athletic activities ( didn’t know any other way to phrase it lol). Start with just standing straight leg and try and touch your toes then I would spread out your feet and go down to the middle and then to each leg keeping in mind you want the opposite hand to touch the foot (I have been stretching for about two weeks and still haven’t accomplished this feat) and hold for about a 10 second count. Then sit on your butt and repeat. Finally I would say work by doing some fire hydrants ( hip stretch ).  If you can get a jump rope or fashion one out of some thing ( ie a real rope or whatever you see fit) and go 3-5 rounds for ab a minute to start and consider it a good beginner workout. Lastly diet I would say everyone knows burn less then you take in but stay away from refined sugar. And we all mess up but even if you can just prolonge the time for you to mess up and eat a sweet, it’s still a victory. Every meal counts and you should treat it like it does but don’t feel bad if you mess up there is always next time don’t let one bad meal through you off course. Sorry for the rant I hope at least part of this is useful."

            " \n\n## WHAT ARE STATIC STRETCHES?\n\nStatic stretches involve holding a muscle in a stretched and challenging (but comfortable), position for a short period of time, normally 10 to 30 seconds. \n\nStatic stretches are an acceptable and safe way of enhancing all-round flexibility and reducing DOMS and soreness after training sessions. It's generally universally accepted that stretches are best-performed post-activity or after a good workout program because it has been found to reduce performance if done before physical activity.\n\nFor improving range of movement for functional movement, however, dynamic stretches pre-workout are considered more beneficial. While both stretches have their pros and cons, today we'll talk about post workout stretches.\n\n## THE BENEFITS OF STATIC STRETCHING FOR MEN AND WOMEN\n\nSpending a few minutes after a tough session in the gym to perform static stretches (never mind the occasional ridiculous pose) could prevent injury and do your body a whole lot of good. Static stretches help improve flexibility, enhance your range of motions, relieve stress and lessen the risk of injuries.   \n\n\nResearchers have found solid evidence that static stretches offer therapeutic benefits when performed post-workout. \n\nThese are the top benefits of static stretching.\n\n### BENEFIT 1: ENHANCED FLEXIBILITY\n\nOne of the key benefits of stretching is improved flexibility of the various muscle groups in the body. While it’s important for fitness, flexibility also helps to reduce muscular tension. It helps stiff and contracted muscles to relax into their original forms. Regularly performing static stretches after a workout will make your body more flexible in no time.\n\nBending, squatting, and other flexibility related motions become a lot easier. Working your muscles hard and then stretching them properly helps the muscles adapt to a greater range of motion and makes it possible to optimally use their capacity the next time.\n\n### BENEFIT 2: ELIMINATES LACTIC ACID\n\nOnce you begin a workout, your body produces lactic acids which cause muscle fatigue and soreness. Performing proper static stretches will relax the muscles and get rid of the lactic acids.\n\n### BENEFIT 3: PREVENTS CRAMPING\n\nExcessive sweating and dehydration while exercising can cause painful muscular cramps. But this is hardly an excuse to skip leg day. Constantly rehydrating with sips of water and stretching those sore muscles will ensure their chancing of cramping up on you are greatly reduced.\n\n### BENEFIT 4: PROMOTES MUSCULAR COORDINATION \n\nStatic stretches improve the ability of the muscles to work in tandem. Consistent stretching makes this possible, and the resultant benefit is better functional mobility of the body’s muscle groups especially if functional strength training is your thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStatic stretches after intense weight training session greatly reduce muscle fatigue and tenderness by speeding recovery time. This gets your muscles fired up and thirsting for the next session.\n\n### BENEFIT 5: COOLS THE BODY DOWN GRADUALLY\n\nStatic stretching decreases muscle tension and increases muscle relaxation making it an ideal as a cool-down activity. Also, gentle stretching slows your racing heart at a gradual pace which puts less stress on your heart.\n\nYour body goes back to normal better when you perform cooldown stretches.  \n\n\n## THE BEST STATIC STRETCHES\n\nWhile there are as many types of static stretches as there are muscles groups in the human body, here is a list of essential stretches to cover a wide range of muscle groups and are considered to be most beneficial by sport medicine experts.   \n\n\n### STANDING QUADRICEPS STRETCH\n\nThe quadriceps are large muscles located at the front of your thighs. Asides from looking good on you, they help to move your upper leg, extend your knee and flex your hip. A tight quad can misalign your hips and put excess stress on your hamstrings. \n\n* Stand straight with one hand placed on a wall for balance. \n* Lift your right foot backward and hold it in place behind you with your right hand - your right heel should be touching your right butt cheek.\n* Pull the foot up towards your glutes while keeping the knee aligned with your hip.\n* Hold this position for about 30 seconds and repeat same on the other side.\n\n### SEATED FORWARD BEND\n\nThe hamstrings are large muscles located on the back of the thighs and extend into your glutes. It causes pulling and pain in your glutes when tight. All three areas can be stretched with the seated forward bend.\n\n* Sit uprightly on the floor with your legs stretched out in front of you. \n* Bend at the hips and lower your torso gently toward your thighs.  \n* Grab your feet, ankles or shin, depending on your flexibility\n* Gently pull yourself towards your thighs and hold for 30 seconds.\n\n### COBRA POSE\n\nThis static stretch routine works your abdominals, chest, shoulders and back at once.\n\n* Lie flat on your stomach on the floor with your legs stretched out behind you.\n* Place your hands under your shoulder with your elbows close to your body.\n* Lift your head toward the ceiling as you straighten your arms while pressing your hands, pelvis, thighs, and feet into the floor.\n* Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds\n\n### POST-WORKOUT CHEST STRETCH\n\nBunched up chest muscles can cause a hunched posture. The standing chest stretch can assist to loosen and lengthen your pecs. \n\n* Stand with your feet hip-width apart and align your shoulders, hips, and ankles.\n* Clasp your hands behind your back and slowly lift your arms until you feel the tension throughout your shoulders and chest.\n* Hold the position for about 30 seconds\n\n### POST-WORKOUT SHOULDER JOINT STRETCH\n\nYour shoulders could also benefit from static stretches. The shoulder handles a wide range of motions and involves the humerus, rib cage, clavicle, thoracic region, and scapula.\n\nThese complex interactions utilize lots of ligaments and muscles for stability. These muscles and ligaments are therefore prone to stiffness and injury\n\n* Hold out a towel in front of you with both hands\n* Slowly raise your arms straight above your head and behind you.\n* Hold this position for 30 seconds whilst ensuring the towel is held tightly\n\n### POST-WORKOUT LAT STRETCH\n\nYour lats or latimissimus dorsi are the powerful muscles that pull your arms closer to your body in exercises like pull up. When they become too tight, they could cause a slouching posture. Loosen up and relax your lats with this simple stretch.\n\n* Put one arm behind your head \n* Raise and place the other arm on top of your elbow and gently pull back while stretching your triceps, \n* Hold the stretch for about 30 seconds\n\n### POST-WORKOUT GROIN STRETCH\n\nThis stretches the groin, inner thighs, glutes, hamstrings and lower back. The groin muscles are some of the biggest muscle groups and function primarily to move the legs. However, they are quite prone to injury.\n\nSo, a little post-workout static stretch routine will help keep them limber and prevent injuries.\n\n* Sit on the floor\n* Bend your knees and firmly bring your feet together\n* Rest your elbows on your knees while holding your feet in your hands\n* Gently press down your knees towards the floor with your elbows while keeping your back straight.\n* Hold this position for about 30 seconds \n\n### POST-WORKOUT CALVES STRETCHES\n\nIt’s easy to ignore smaller muscle groups. But your calves deserve some love too because they play a major role in leg movement. Tightness in the calves could cause pain and imbalance.\n\n* Get into a seating position on the floor.\n* Stretch out your right leg and bend your left leg at the knees, so the left foot is resting on the inside of the right leg.\n* Reach for your right foot with your right hand while bending from the hip and pull it gently towards you. \n* Maintain this pose for about 30 seconds\n* Repeat on the other side.\n\n### POST-WORKOUT HIP FLEXORS STRETCH\n\nYour hip flexors are a muscle group at the top of your thighs that are responsible for moving your lower body. They make it possible for you to walk, kick, bend, and swivel your hips.\n\nStatic stretches will keep the hip flexors flexible and prevent tightness which can lead to a hip flexor strain.\n\n* Assume a kneeling position on the floor\n* Take a large step forward with your right leg so that you are in a lunge position.\n* With your upper body upright, push your hips forward till you feel a stretch on the front of your trailing leg.\n* Stay in that position for 20 to 30 seconds.\n* Repeat with your left leg forward.\n\n### POST-WORKOUT GLUTES STRETCH\n\nGetting the perfect set of butts seems to be all the rage these days. But with all the lunges, squats, hip thrusts, and step-ups, you need to show your glutes some love- they are about the biggest muscle groups in your body after all.\n\nStatic stretches targeting the glutes will improve flexibility and loosen any tension or tightness in the glutes and hips.\n\n* Stand with  both feet shoulder-width apart on  the floor\n* Raise your right leg and rest the ankle on your left knee.\n* Press down on your right knee with your right elbow while bending your left knee in a single leg squat.\n* Hold the pose for about 30 seconds.\n* Repeat with the other leg\n\nThis list is not exhaustive. But getting started on these basics will go a long way to maximize your workout and enable you to attain your fitness goals faster, including building muscle, losing fat and getting abs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a general safety guideline, static stretches should never be painful. If a technique causes you pain, reduce the range and build up gradually. Stretch only to the point where you are comfortable holding that position for 30 seconds. \n\nYou should hold each stretch for a minimum of 15 to 20 seconds for 1 to 2 rounds. As your flexibility improves, you can hold the stretches for longer durations for better results. Make sure to stretch each side equally.\n\nAlways breathe throughout each technique. Breathing helps to relax your body and helps deepen the stretch.\n\n#### SHOULD I STRETCH AFTER WORKING OUT?\n\nIf you want to stay injury-free, limber and flexible, post-workout stretches are the way to go. What stops many people from static stretching properly after work out is the belief they don’t have enough time. But what they really need for a proper cool-down post-workout stretch is only 10 minutes.  \n\n\nStretching consistently and regularly helps improve flexibility, increases the range of motion and reduces the risk of injury caused by abrasions of the connective tissue. In addition, stretching is great stress relief and helps improve mindfulness and mind-body connection. \n\nFor guys following my Shredded workout program, I strongly advise taking the time to stretch after your workout.\n\nSo after your next workout, don’t be in a hurry to head home to shower. Take a couple minutes to stretch, flush out the flush out the lactic acid and this will help avoid injury and cramps and help you maximize your next training session.\n\nVisit Hustler Fitness to learn other workout techniques!",
            "There is a difference between sore pain versus injury pain. You are mostly likely sore from doing a lot when your arms arent overly used to it. Use ice and stretch some, but don't miss your next arm workout. In fact, that would probably relieve any soreness as long as you focus on slow controlled light reps. Once workout consistency develops, the soreness will be easier to control. "

            "So I’m trying to build a lot of muscle mass and burn fat to stay lean by cardio. I mostly do only body weight training and I was wondering how can I consume 120grams of protein 60g before and after my workout.

Also if you use a protein shake as a \"meal\" it helps you lose weight by effectively making you intake less than your expenditure. I wouldn't do that every day, just days you work out. Anyway, quality protein is also important. I'm personally not a fan of whey protein because I'm partially lactose intolerant, and don't think dairy is a good idea anyway. So I use vegan brands. You can also just eat more protein, but powder blends are just way easier. Arguably more cost effective. ",
            "Refer to my article I wrote on my website about protein powder. http://howtogains.com/index.php/2017/02/21/protein-powder-explained/",
            "First and foremost, good job getting into a workout routine! I don't know if you had been semi active before you've started on this current type of workout for the last month and a half, but either way, kudos to you. \nWhen it comes to working out and exploring protein choices I would first recommend that you take a look at your diet and evaluate how much protein you get from the food you eat. You're working out/doing resistance training 3 times a week so on those days you definitely want to up your protein intake (obviously). You should have a solid amount of protein for every meal but a particularly important time to make sure you have protein in your system is within the hour after you finish exercise. This is called your anabolic window. After you workout, your body is going to start revving up to breakdown the damaged muscle tissue and set up for building more (hypertrophy). Eating a combination of protein and carbs will give your body a pool of glucose and amino acids to pull from in the reactions that take place to breakdown/build up muscle. The majority of your protein should come from your food. \nThe only time I would really recommend that you use supplements like protein powder is if you are not getting enough protein from your diet. For those guys and girls that workout for prolonged periods of time in the gym doing extensive/high intensity resistance training, the amount of protein that they need to ingest might be unrealistic to expect from their diet. So that's where the protein powders come in.\nIf you are seriously considering using protein powder, a good start would be to look into whey protein which is very common. Whey protein is quick to metabolize, so drinking it within your anabolic window will give you a good boost of amino acids that will be readily available for your body to use. That's a good thing! Protein powders that have at least 80% whey protein are solid options. You want more bang for your buck! What's the point of drinking protein powder if most of it isn't in fact protein? Check the ingredients list on the protein powders. If they don't have a form of whey listed as the first ingredient then they probably aren't very densely packed with protein.\nI would be careful though. Just because you use protein powder does not mean you will get muscles faster. It just ensures that you're giving your body the building blocks it needs to build the muscle. Just packing your diet with tons of protein is not the solution for everyone. If you eat too much protein and you don't need all of it then your body can use it to produce fat as a means to store energy. Our bodies are fantastic that way and it was very handy back when early hunter/gatherers needed to save the extra stores of energy in case they went without food. \nSo I'll end this loooonnnggg response by saying, check to see how much protein you get from your diet. Look online for apps that give good suggestions to how much protein you should be eating based on your fitness level (it will give you a ballpark estimate at least) and compare the two. If you are coming up short in your diet then consider eating a higher proportion of protein in you diet and if you still think that isn't enough then explore your options for protein powders that have a very high proportion of protein. I use ON gold standard whey protein powder, but don't just use that because that's what I use. Do your homework! Part of the fun of getting into a workout regimen is experimenting to see what type of exercise and what diet works best for your body. Everyone is different. Plus, you're 15. You have so much of your prime years ahead of you to see what works. Diet first. Supplements later.",
            "Yeah I mainly do protein shakes because I don't have a lot of dietary protein. If you have too much protein than you need it just gets converted to fat. And extreme excess is bad for your liver and kidneys. Goes back to the whole moderation thing. What's nice is you can make a shake and take it with you. Maybe pack it with nutrients and consider it a meal if you're trying to cut down. It all depends on your needs/goals. A body builder will need way more protein than average gym goer. ",

The only recommendation is not to combine high-fat protein products and large portions of carbohydrates. \n\nDo not forget about foods rich in fiber. Eat fresh green vegetables every day.

            "Myth: Maintain a steady supply of amino acids by eating protein every 2-3 hours. The body can only absorb 30 grams of protein in one sitting.\n\nTruth\n\nWhenever you hear something really crazy you need to ask yourself if it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. It's a great way to quickly determine if something may be valid or if it's more likely a steaming pile of horseshit. This myth is a great example of the latter. Do you think we would be here today if our bodies could only make use of 30 grams of protein per meal?\n\nThe simple truth is that more protein just takes a longer time to digest and be utilized. For some concrete numbers, digestion of a standard meal is still incomplete after five hours. Amino acids are still being released into your bloodstream and absorbed into muscles. You are still \"anabolic.\" This is a fairly standard \"Average Joe\"-meal: 600 kcal, 75 g carbs, 37 g protein and 17 g fat. Best of all? This was after eating pizza, a refined food that should be quickly absorbed relatively speaking.\n\nThink about this for a second. How long do you think a big steak, with double the protein intake of the above example, and a big pile of veggies would last you? More than 10 hours, that's for sure. Meal composition plays an important role in absorption speed, especially when it comes to amino acids. Type of protein, fiber, carbohydrates and prior meals eaten all affect how long you'll have amino acids released and being taken up by tissues after meals.\n\nJust to really drive this home - the source of this myth is the fact that your body can only absorb about 25g of protein/hour. That's actually been pretty well tested and is true. This led some people who weren't thinking very clearly to conclude that you must only be able to absorb 25g of protein in a 'sitting' - a sitting's just about an hour right?\n",

I've got plenty of inspiration. I don't think that is the problem. But whenever I start a new workout or program I always go into the first 2 weeks strong. Then I start to feel like it's not helping. I don't feel the stiffness the next day. I don't feel it right after either. So I just kinda give up on it. I hate myself for doing it. But if I continue to keep going with a program it seems like my form is bad. Just the drive to do it is gone. Anyways, I bet you can understand my struggles.\nSo this summer I really want to do as much as I can. I need to find something that makes me feal like I'm really doing something worth while. As I said before I'm at 150lb now. My goal is to reach 165 before these 3 months are over.  \nIf anyone has some really good ideas or advice I'd love to hear about them. Feel free to send me a message too. Be happy to chat about it. Thanks for your time",

I've been doing gentle yoga and the 20 minute walks, but I'm going to need some suggestions for when I'm stuck inside this winter.

I need some advice on how/where to start, what excercises to start doing, etc. I have never really had a workout \"schedule\" because I have never been able to just get up and motivate myself to do it, but now it is really important to me for skiing, and other reasons as well.

Get your cardio up, lose a bit of fat (though at 6''1' I don't see you as being at all over weight) and then start going to a gym. The running actually becomes fun after a while so you won't dread doing it. Also simple pushups and situps can do wonders for your core, plus you can do them while you watch tv!

            "Hey man, congrats on setting a goal &amp; choosing a healthy lifestyle.  Becoming disciplined in a healthy lifestyle will help immensely in life.  I would first start working on your diet.  You are 18 years old, so your metabolism is in your favor.  I would recommend switching to a clean diet, eliminating all processed food &amp; sugars.  Stick to eggs, meat, veggies, and don't crazy on fruits.  For fruits, I would stick to berries.  But, like I said, don't go crazy with the fruits.  Look online for a workout routine.  I would recommend starting strength by Mark Rippetoe.  I know you said you don't want to pack on muscle, but you will burn plenty of fat lifting.  I would buy Starting Strength 3rd Edition, and start reading it immediately.  While you are waiting for that to get delivered from Amazon, start doing calisthenics.  Do push ups, body squats, pull ups, crunches, jumping jacks, and jump rope.  And stretch after exercising.  Throw in sprints twice a week.  When the book arrives, start lifting the Starting Strength Novice Routine.  I hope this helps, good luck!!",

And congratulations on the already phenomenal weight loss! 80 pounds ain't no joke!\nTo start: This sub is pretty dead, you would have a better time over at r/fitness. \nHowever, some advice I have for you:\n-Since you have quite a bit of weight to lose, it might be best to consult your doctor before beginning your journey to discuss any  possible medical precautions and for general advice on diet and nutrition. \n-Diet is key. You will not see the results you'd like without sticking to a major diet change. Perhaps a calorie counting app, such as myFitnessPal, would be a good starting point. Apps such as that let you log all food intake and give you daily calorie goals to meet depending on your stats. \n-Start slow. No need to jump into professional body building from the get-go. Work at a pace that will challenge you, but won't leave you completely gasping for air. Modify exercises as needed. Can't do standard crunches? Modify by trying a standing bicycle crunch!\n\nGranted, I am not a professional. But from my personal experience, these key ideas really help anyone trying to get in shape. \nGood luck!! :)",

            "Hey there twin! I am going to answer the question you didn't ask.\n\nFirst, congrats on starting to take the first mental step. You are going to get a lot of advice but let me share it from the the first person point of view (I was 324lbs. 2 months ago). My biggest problem with these forums are when people give advice without understanding the true situation the person is in and frankly unless you have been 300+ I don't think you are qualified to give advice to someone who is without legit education.\n\nStep 1: When you are this heavy your focus shold not be on excersize but on diet. By altering what you eat you can start melting weight off. Breakng it down simply you are taking in way more calories than you are buring and it is time to reverse that. Start educating yourself before diving in.  Learn how to calorie count and start eating 5 small meals a day. This helps you feel relatively full and keeps your metabolism going strong. Determine what your target calorie count for the day is and build your meals accordingly. Oh yeah, prepare your meals ahead of time to make things way easier.  Prep a whole bunch of small meals that you can grab when needed or else you are going to end up at the drivethru. Low calorie protein shakes make nice meal replacements as well. They are easy to make and filling.  You have to get used to eating less, deal with it. Go ahead and start with a 2,000 calorie target, I bet your taking in closer to 4k-5k now without even realizing it. These diets that say eat as much as you want but only of \"this type of food\" are BS for guys like us because they don't realize the kind of appetite we have. If I eat a bucket of low cal grilled chicken breasts I am eating super healthy but I am still going to take in so much food that the calories will exceed what I can burn, and I won't make any progress. Once you get your calories and portions under control you will realize you were actually eating enough food to feed a small village, even if it was healthy food, there were just too many calories being consumed.\n\nStep 2: Keep the excersize light. Your body doesn't function well when your this big, your are not meant to carry this much weight. It is easy to injur yourself right now and you don't want an injury because it will set you back before you get started. Start with a daily stretching routine.  Advance that routine into some yoga poses.  Focus on strengthening your core because your core supports your back and your back is vulnerable at this weight, especially if you have shitty posture I bet you have no core strength. Start walking but stop when things start hurting (feet, ankles, knees, hips, and back, pay attention to all of them).\n\nStep 3: Your body will let you know when it's time to increase your physical activity, but it is not ready right now. When your ready come back here and ask the question you just asked again.\n\nWrap Up: Things won't change over night but they can change real fast if you commit to it, especiall because your so young. I am 7 weeks into a new healthier lifestyle. I have dropped 60lbs. since starting (under 2 months) and I am only now getting ready to start lifting.  My benchmark was to hit 250lbs. before I went back to lifting but I am listenting to my body.  I have lost that weight so far purely off of diet and very light cardio.  I could barley squeek out walking a mile without my body throbing at 324lbs. but now I can go 3-5 miles no problem.  My body feels like it is being unshackled as I continue to lose and my mobility and energy are coming back.  I still have a long way to go but I am committed. You can do it too.\n\nPM me if you want any more details, I think I have written enough at this point. This is my $.02\n\n- 100lb. Beard",

You want to work the whole body out, but do it by parts instead as a whole; it reduces the amount of time spent recovering and or getting an early injury. Also, as you work out, be sure to change your diet as you go and find one suited for you. The same is for sleeping. I recommend you sleep for about 8+ hours and you can lower it as you go. The real muscle building happens when you sleep after all. \n\nAs for push-ups, do some knee push-ups instead.

My favorite, a good place to start will just be doing squats, lunges (forward and backward), burpees, calf raises. By doing body weight at first, you’ll learn the movement correctly and start building stability muscles. There’s also quad, hamstring, adductor and abductor machines if you choose the gym route!\nWednesday- depending on how the first 2 days went I’d usually do core and stretching.\nThursday- “hard” cardio, more running and sprints, pushing 45 pound plates across a track, just anything that’s REALLY going to make your heart work.\nFriday- arm day, I hate arm day I was never good at it. Start with low weights and 8-10 reps for 3 sets on whatever muscle your targeting. Biceps, do bicep curls, tricep extensions (for triceps), military press (and lateral raises) for your shoulders.\n\nObviously that’s not all the muscle groups, so I’d interchange chest and back during the week.

Starting on cone 1, run to cone 2 and back, then cone 3 and back, 4 and back, then 5 and back. The sprint should be flat out and with emphasis on sharp turns. Rest for 30 seconds and repeat. Rest another 30 seconds and repeat for a third time. This is one set. Rest for 2 minutes with active recovery such as walking. Complete a total of 3-5 sets.\n\nDrill # 3 - Progressive Shuttles \nLactate tolerance training - shuttles\n\nAn excellent variation on classic shuttles! Set out 5 cones 10 meters/yard apart. Look at the diagram below. Starting on cone 1, jog to cone 4 then immediately sprint to cone 5. Turn and jog to cone 3 and then sprint to cone 1. Turn and jog to cone 2 and sprint to cone 5. Finally, turn immediately and sprint to cone 1. Rest for 60 seconds and repeat 3-5 times. This is one set. Complete 2-3 sets.\n\nDrill #4 - Union Jacks\nLatate tolerance training - diagonals\n\nMark out an area of approximately 50yards/meters by 50yards/meters. Starting at one corner, sprint diagonally across the square to the opposite corner. Immediately turn and sprint halfway along one side. Jog the rest of the way down this side of the square. Turn and sprint diagonally to the opposite corner. Now, turn and sprint halfway along this side of the square, then jog back to the start position. This is one set. Rest for 2 minutes with active recovery. Compete 4-6 sets. \n",

            "Hey Reddit! \n\nWARNING: LARGE WALL OF TEXT INCOMING \n\nBefore we start, here is a small taste of what I can do on the court. This is a short video of me playing my friend Fedrick, 1-1. I am the tall, lanky, white guy, without a shirt. \n\n(The sounds/voices are annoying. I would recommend watching with the sound off.)\n\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=781QM3D9NfA\n\nI have been playing basketball ever since I was 5. I am a 6'1 sf/pf/c. I am 15, in 9th grade and made the freshman team this year. The season ended and a decline in my game was obvious. Last year I averaged 25 ppg, 20 rbg, with 8 apg. This year I averaged 8 ppg, 10 rbg, with 2 apg. I had my moments this year, such as the last game getting 25 and 15. The time when I single-highhandedly scored my teams last 10, and hit a game winner. But the decline in my game was obvious. In the summer before the season, every day I biked 3 miles to the basketball court and 3 miles back, and played for about 6 hours a day. During this time, I revamped my entire shooting form (Thanks pro shot!). I am now a great shooter from 3, shooting around 50%. I slightly worked on my dribbling ability. This year my coach absolutely hated me, for a reason I do not know. He loved the other center though. In practice I hit numerous 3's, yet he did not acknowledge this until the last game and got mad when I took 3's. But, enough about my stupid coach. I believe this decline in my game came down to 4 big reasons.  \n\n1. The coach \n2. A ball hog of a point guard, who wouldn't pass to me. Even in events when I had proven myself \n3. Me not being strong enough \n4. Me not being fast enough\n\nTo combat the final two issues, I got a job and pay per monthly for an LA Fitness membership.  They have every machine and fitness area one could imagine, even classes like yoga, spinning, etc. They even have a pool and basketball court. For the last 2 weeks, I have been going roughly 3 days a week, going for 4-7 hours at a time. Here is a list of things I need to improve, and that I need your help with. \n\n1. Upper Body Strength \n2. Arm Strength \n3. Core Strength \n4. Leg Strength \n5. Vertical \n6. Speed \n7. Quickness \n8. Endurance \n9. Ball Handling \n\nHere is what I have been doing to increase in each of these areas. \n\n1. Upper Body Strength- I have been doing bench presses, and free weights. I have only done each of these activities once ever. My max on bench press was 40 on each side, with a Olympic bar. The free weights, I had no clue what exercises to do, so I did 10 reps with a 30 pound weight in each hand. \n\n2. Arm Strength- I used a machine where you lift the weight, starting at your chest and going above your head. My max was 10 reps with 80 pounds. \n\n3. Core Strength- I have been using an ab machine, where one puts there chest onto two padded areas, with their knees on a pad and lifts weight using only their abs. I have done 10 reps on each side, with 170 pounds being my max. The machine goes up to 190 pounds, so I can almost max it out. I have also been using a machine called an ab glider, using it with its max, 20 pounds on each side. With that machine I can do 50 reps going forward, and I did 25 on each side, but could probably do 50 on each side. \n\n4. Leg Strength- I have been doing the machine assisted squats, with 50 pounds on each side, 10 reps being my max. I have also been doing a seated leg press at 10 reps, 200 pounds. I have also done a 45 degree angle leg press, at 10 reps, with 60 pounds on each side. My calves are somewhat small, but my quads are somewhat big. \n\n5. Vertical- I have been doing a lot of pylometrics. I have doing a box jump, with my max being 10 reps, at about 2.5 feet. And a side box jump (Like a box jump with one foot, switching the feet repetitively)  with my max being 10 reps at about 1.9 feet. The side jump helps with speed as well.\n\n6. Speed- I have been using the spinning machines for about 20 minutes on gear 15. I have been using a treadmill for about 25 minutes, increasing the speed by 1 every minute, starting at 7 or 8. This also pairs with endurance. \n\n7/8. Quickness/Endurance- Look above \n\n9. Ball handling- I have not been doing ball handling as much, as the court is usually crowded. But this is the workout I plan to use, Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJEb6O-cjhU Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRRsn_ixsMA \nI also plan to learn all of the other moves on his channel. \n\nMy Main Concerns: \nI mainly don't want to injure myself, or stunt my growth. But at the same time I want to become a great basketball player, and strive to make varsity and become an all-star next year. I really would like to average 30 ppg, 20 rbg, and 10 apg, and would love to play sg/sf. \n\nIs there anything I should do to improve my game in other areas, and what are some things I can be doing to improve in the areas I listed above? Is there anything I am doing wrong? Am I doing things right? Please leave any comments, concerns or suggestions! Thanks for reading! Sorry for the wall of text.\n",

            "Not for the faint hearted.  This is a serious muscle mass increasing  workout supposedly founded in the 1970’s, in country known as Germany (well duh). It was generally performed by bodybuilders during the off season. Initially it was made famous by the German national weightlifting coach Rolf Feser, before being implemented by the 1984 Olympic power lifting silver medalist Jacques Demers and the phenomenal female powerlifting and bodybuilding champion Bev Francis.\n\nThis German Volume Training (otherwise known as GVT for short) implements an intensive 10 set by 10 rep method to rapidly increase muscle mass. This extensive high volume training, places the muscles under exceptional amounts of stress, especially on the last couple of sets. This is the stress impetus that helps make your muscles grow.\n\n“Strength Sensei” Charles Poliquin, who is one of the worlds most renowned strength coaches, who popularised GVT in the 90’s and gave the workout its name (although he did not come up with the methodology), has gone on to state “this program adds muscle fast is probably an understatement. Gains of ten pounds or more in six weeks are not uncommon, even in experienced lifters.”\n\nHere is a link to the coach Charles Poloquins site on GVT: http://www.strengthsensei.com/introduction-to-the-german-volume-training/\n\nA GVT should be performed for 4-8 weeks with weights which you could do  20 repetitions on a single set or 60% of your one rep max. You should work using antagonistic muscle groups – Chest and Back, an Overhead Press and a Lat exercise (pull down or pull ups), Quads and Hamstrings, or Biceps and Triceps.\n\nAn example of a GVT schedule with 90 seconds rest between compound sets and 60 seconds of rest between complementary sets is as follows:\n\nDay 1: Chest and Back\n\n10 x 10 – Decline Bench Press\n10 x 10 – Chin-Up\nComplement with:\n\n3 x 10 – Face Pull\n3 x 10 – Incline Bench Press\n3 x 10 – Cable Lat Pulldown\nDay 2: Legs and Abs\n\n10 x 10 – Back Squat\n10 x 10 – Hamstring Curl\nComplement with:\n\n3 x 10 – Leg Raise\n3 x 10 – Calf Raise\n \n\nDay 3: Rest\n\nDay 4: Arms and Shoulders\n\n10 x 10 – Parallel Bar Dips\n10 x 10 – Dumbbell Curls\nComplement with:\n\n3 x 15 – Resistance Band Pull Apart\n3 x 10 – Lying Rear Delt Fly\n3 x 10 – Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press\nDay 5: Rest\n\nDay 6 &amp; 7: Start again from Day 1 routine",

            "Hey guys! So about 2.5 months ago I really started to take my workouts very seriously and finally had a goal set in my mind that I was finally gonna put some good weight on and bulk up. A little info, I have played soccer my whole life, so I have been pretty skinny, but I am an average height of 6 feet tall and also 20 years of age in college currently.\n\nSo my plan is the PHUL workout plan, but I have modified it a bit. Days 3 and 7 are both rest days.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDay 1: Upper Body Heavy Weight\n\n\nFlat Bench Press: 4 sets, 3-5 Reps\n\n\nIncline Dumbbell Fly: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nBent Over Barbell Row: 4 Sets, 3-5 Reps\n\n\nLat Pull Down: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nOverhead Press: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nBarbell Curl: 4 Sets, 3-5 Reps\n\n\nBarbell Preacher Curl: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nOverhead Dumbbell Dip: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nFinish with a 10 Minute Run\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDay 2: Legs Heavy Weight\n\n\nStart with 10-15 minute bike ride (Light, to warm up legs)\n\n\nSquat: 4 Sets, 3-5 Reps\n\n\nLunges: 4 Sets, 6 Reps\n\n\nLeg Press: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nLeg Curls: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nStanding Calf Raise: 4 Sets, 15 Reps\n\n\nFinish with 3 Sets of Abs Circuit\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDay 4: Upper Body Hypertrophy\n\n\nIncline Barbell Bench Press: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nFlat Bench Dumbbell Fly: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nSeated Cable Row: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nOne Arm Dumbbell Row: 4 Sets, 8 -12 Reps\n\n\nDumbbell Lateral Raise: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nConcentrated Curls: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nHammer Curls: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nTricep Cable Pulldown: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDay 5: Legs Hypertrophy\n\n\n10-15 minutes Bike (light to warm up legs)\n\n\nFront Squat: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nBarbell Lunge: 4 Sets, 10 Reps\n\n\nLeg Extension, Leg Curl (Super Set): 4 Sets, 10-15 Reps\n\n\nSeated Calf Raise: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nStanding Calf Raise: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDay 6: Core and Running\n\n\n15 Minute Run\n\n\n3 Sets of ab circuit along with 3 sets of core circuit\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nNow that I have laid out my workout plan I will tell you my goals and what I eat.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nGoals: I started out at 134 pounds and have managed to go up to 145 pounds while remaining at roughly 10% body fat (measured at 143.5 pounds). My goal is to get up to 155-160 pounds and then cut from there. Right now I am eating about 3000 calories a day with my macros at 40% carbs, 40% protein, and 20% fat (admittedly this has been skewed the past couple weeks cause of the holidays, don't @ me cookies are good lol). \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo looking at my goals and current workout plan I have a couple questions for you guys.\n\n\n- Is my workout plan going to get me where I want to get to? Am I missing anything critical\n\n\n- Diet wise, is this about where I should be at for macros and caloric intake to get a good steady/ healthy weight gain?",

            "Okay thanks. Right now I'm at 185 like I said. I go to the gym about 3 days a week on average. I'm about 14% body fat or so. My workout routine consists of usually:\nDay 1- Chest/triceps/biceps\n   -Flat Bar Bench, only one set of 10-12 of 195lbs because I don't always have a spotter\n   -Flat Dumbbell Press, 3-4 sets of 10-12 with 75-80 pound dumbbells\n   -Freeweight Pec Flys, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with 45-50 pound dumbbells\n   -Chest Cable Flys, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with 45 pounds resistance\n   -Pec Fly, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with 205lbs resistance\n   -(not every time) Decline Bench Press, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with about 205-215lbs\n   -(not every time) Incline Bench Press, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with about 175lbs\n   -Skullcrushers, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with about 70-80lbs\n   -Tricep Dips, 3-4 sets of 15-20\n   -Tricep Extension with cables, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with about 60lbs\n   -Hammer curls, 3-4 sets of 10-12 with 45 pound dumbbells\n   -Pull ups, 3-4 sets pf 10-15\n   -Curls with curling bar, 2-3 sets of 10-12 of 75-80lbs\n   -Curls on curling machine, 3-4 sets of 10-12 of about 55-60lbs with each hand\n   -Finish with full extension curls sitting down, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with 40lb dumbbells\n   -This is about an average workout. It changes sometimes, like I'll do drop sets and increase the weight after a set also depending on the day, but in general this is pretty good to go off of\n\nDay 2- Shoulders/Back/Biceps\n   -Incline Bench Press, again only one set because of lack of spotter usually, 175lbs\n   -Shoulder Press, again only one set because of lack of spotter, 125lbs\n   -Freeweight Incline Press, 3-4 sets of 10-12 with 60 pound dumbbells\n   -Freeweight Shoulder Press, 3-4 sets of 10-12 with 35-40 pound dumbbells\n   -Shrugs with bar, 3-4 sets with about 205\n   -Front raises with curling bar, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with about 80-90lbs\n   -Rows, 3-4 sets of 10-12 with 65 pound dumbbells\n   -Deltoid Fly, 2-3 sets of 8-10 with about 105 pounds\n   -Reverse Fly, 2-3 sets of 8-10 with about 135 pounds\n   -Again, this is just in general. It seems sort of structured, but these are really just general guidelines for my workout. I really need to tighten it up\n\nDay 3- Legs/Whatever Else\n  -Leg Press, 4-5 sets of 10-12, 400-420 pounds\n  -Variety of calf exercises that I don't know the name of, sorry, but there are a few.\n   -Whatever I think I missed before and need to hit more\n   -Legs I really need to step up on, I don't do enough with them. I sort of stopped after my back injury, but aside from squats and deadlifts, I should be able to do most leg exercises again. As you can see, my workouts need a little structure\n\nI run 2 miles, usually like 2 days a week.\n\nAverage diet consists of cereal or toast plus milk for breakfast. I've stopped all junk food breakfasts(e.g. donuts, too many bagels, etc.). Then lunch is almost always some sort of sandwich with usually fruit and milk. The sandwich could be ham and cheese, pb&amp;j, turkey and cheese, etc. Dinner is a wide variety, but usually includes a good amount of protein. I've started to avoid fast food now, but unhealthy foods still sneak in on occasion, which is going to stop. I'm starting a new lower calorie, higher protein intake diet. Before this, despite the fact that I was active, it wasn't enough to burn off all of the empty calories I was getting from soda and junk/snack foods etc. Soda's completely out now, as well as most junk foods. I'm going to adhere to this completely. I've done it before, so I'm not too worried about not being about to meet my expectations. \n",

I would say amp it up a bit for now maybe 3 sets of 20 crunches (not sit ups) in quick succession followed by 3 sets of 20 push ups in quick succession. After you can do these without going too far into depletion/negatives change to doing 3 sets of  20 crunches with oblique twists (or jacknives or V-leg extensions) followed by 3 sets of 20 push up variants (A-frame, punch and press, travellers, etc.) depending on where you want to hit.\n\nWorking as you are though you can do it every day with Sunday/Saturday as your rest day, every other day is only really necessary if your doing tear and repair/depletion training which is what I've told you to do.

Jogging burns maybe a 1/4 of the calories you intake per day.  Eating a lot (unhealthy food) negates the calories you burned on that day since you're taking more calories.  Be wary of the things you eat and serve your food on a smaller plate. What I would do if I were you is do 8 sets, yes 8, of 4 workout routines per day.

Generally I'd say you if you can't hit  8 reps in a set consistently then you're not ready for that weight. Once you can do 2 sets of 12 and 2 sets of 10 at a given weight you're probably ready to move up. This is advice that not be as relevant to you yet, but as you get older it will be.

            "This is a pretty typical lifting schedule to gain muscle. \n\nMonday - Chest: Bench 4x10, incline dumbbell press 4x10, flys 3 x 15.\n\nTuesday - Back: Pull ups 20-40, Sitting row 4 x 10-12, Lat pull down 4 x 10-12, single arm bent over rows 4 x 10.\n\nWednesday - Legs: weighted front/back squat 4 x 10, weighted lunges 3 x 20, calf press 60-100, dead lifts 4 x 10, leg extensions 4 x 10-12.\n\nThursday - Shoulders: Military/shoulder press 4x10, lateral and front raises 3x12 each superset, upright rows 4x10, shrugs 3x20 heavy. \n\nFriday - Arms: Narrow grip pull ups 20-40, dips 40-60, Dumbbell curls 4x10-15, tricep extensions 4x12-15, barbell curls narrow grip 4x10-12, skull crushers 4x12. \n\n\nObviously you can change out practically anything in here but this is just a basic layout. Try and make the weight heavy enough where you can just barely bust out the number of reps given. Always stretch before and after. Engage your core in everything you do. Warm down with 10-15 minutes of abs 3 days a week. 5 min cardio warmup beforehand, I prefer elliptical. \n\nTry and consume 150g of lean protein a day. It's difficult but doable. \n\n",

Increasing the weight each set to a point where you can hardly complete the last rep of each set. And then drop it back down to a starting weight and pump out 10 more as a finisher. ",
            "Bicep &amp; Back Day\n\nAlternating Dumbbell Curls - 5 Sets w/ a DropSet of atleast half of the max weight you can do.\n\nHammer Curls - 5 Sets\n\nBarbell Curls - 6 Sets w/ a DropSet of atleast half of the max weight you can do.\n\nOlympic Bar Curls - No weight, burn out with 3 or 4 sets as many reps possible\n\nBack\n\nWide Gripped Lat Pulldown - 3 Sets \nInner Gripped Lat Pulldown - 3 Sets\nCable Row - 5 Sets\nDeadlift - 6 Sets\n\n\n\nChest &amp; Tricep\n\nFlat Bench Press - 4 Sets Heavy\n\nIncline Dumbbell Chest Press - 4 Sets\n\nPec Dec - 5 Sets\n\nTricep\n\nRope Pulldown - 6 Sets\n\nReverse Gripped Pulldown - 4 Sets\n\nOverhead Extension - 4 Sets\n\nTricep Pushdown - 4 Sets\n\nShoulders &amp; Legs\n\nShoulder Dumbbell Press - 3 Sets Heavy\n\nLateral Raise - 5 Sets (Each set = 30 reps, I start with 20lb Dumbbells and do 10, drop down to 15lb and do 10, and 7.5 and do 10) Repeat for 5 sets\n\nFront Delt Raise - 5 Sets, same as above.\n\nArnold Flys for Back Delts - 5 Sets, same as above but with lighter weight (15, 7.5, 5)\n\nLegs\n\nFree Barbell Squats - 4 Sets Heavy\n\nLeg Curls - 4 Sets\n\nCalf Extensions - 5 Sets\n\nDumbbell Walking Lunges - 6 Laps Total\n\nFor Abs, I sprinkle workouts throughout the week. On Bicep and Back day I'll usually do an Oblique machine, and heavy crunches on a machine. The other days I'll focus on Leg Raises and side dips.\n\n\nNow, the most important thing is eating. My exact macros are listed below. I usually eat 4 egg whites and one whole egg in the morning. In the eggs I add 6 slices of Black Forest ham, one whole tomato, 100 grams of onions, and 2 slices of Sara Lee wheat bread. Before that, I have 70 grams of oatmeal, one scoop of MyProtein Vanilla in the oatmeal, a whole banana, and a oatmeal raisin cliff bar. \n\nFor lunch I have 10 ounces of chicken breast and 10 ounces of brown rice. I add 8 table spoons of a low calorie salsa for flavor. Every other day I eat 4 servings of either sweet peas, or corn with the chicken and rice.\n\nFor dinner it's usually a beef or a fish. I had tuna steaks yesterday, today I will double up on my chicken. I also drink 2 scoops of protein with this meal because I workout around this time.\n\nRight before bed, I have a fruit (roughly 10ounces) and 2 apple cinnamon rice cakes with Waldens Farms chocolate syrup. And I drink one last scoop of protein with cinnamon, and vanilla extract to keep me anabolic over night.\n\nSee the macros below:\n\nProtein: 318g\nCarbs: 392g\nFiber: 53g\nSugar: 148g\nFat: 42g\n\n\nThis is the schedule and diet that works extremely well for me but it takes time. And you will want to switch up your workouts. All of the workouts I listed above are once a week. But I workout every muscle group twice a week. For instance, Monday I will do Bicep Back, Tuesday I will do Chest Tricep, Wednesday I will do Shoulders Legs, and then break one day. Friday is Bicep Back, Saturday is Chest Tricep, and Sunday is Shoulder Leg. \n\nRepeat and be consistent. You have to be consistent and you have to eat properly.\n\nHope this helps!",
            "&gt; you’ll burn 1000 calories in under 10 minutes\n\nIf you burn calories, you'll exhale CO2. Assuming you normally burn 2000 calories a day, and you have [around 20000 breaths](http://www.answers.com/Q/How_many_breaths_does_a_person_average_each_day) to expel the CO2 produced by that.\n\nTo burn 1000 calories in 10 minutes, you'd need to pretty much exhale half of your daily volume of CO2 in those 10 minutes, so you'd breathe 10000 times in 10 minutes, or 1000 times per minute, or 16-17 times per second. Keep in mind those are full breaths, not some kind of flat hyperventilation.\n\nThis doesn't math. \n\nLet's try another way. You exhale [1kg](http://www.answers.com/Q/How_much_co2_does_human_body_emit) of CO2 per day. So let's estimate you'd have to exhale 500g of CO2 in 10 minutes. At [1.98kg/m³](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide#Physical_properties), that would be around 0.3 m³ or 300 litres of pure CO2. Each breath replaces around [350 ml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system#Gas_exchange) of gas in the lungs, so if you exhaled pure CO2 you'd have to breathe around 1000 times in 10 minutes, 100 times per minute or 1-2 times a second. Of course, you only exhale [~ 5% CO2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing#Composition), so we have to multiply that by a factor of 20, so around 35 breaths/second.\n\nSo I highly doubt burning 1000 calories in 10 minutes is possible. Maybe someone wants to estimate whether your clothes would catch fire from the heat produced if you did?",

            "I was you a few years ago. I hired a fancy trainer and paid a ton of $. Basically she taught me to not kill myself in the beginning. All that stuff about macros, and specialized muscle targeting and rest days etc is for people who are working out *much* harder than a beginner is ready for. \n\nWork out 4-6 days a week for 40-60m. The routine of doing it is what's important in the beginning. Don't kill yourself - your goal should be very mildy sore the next day. A good metric is always that you could carry on a conversation but not sing a song during your workout. Just do all over stuff within your skill set. Aim for 10-15 reps of whatever. If you can do way more it's not hard enough if you can't get to 10 it's way too hard. Set small, reasonable goals for yourself. If you can do 10 consecutive pushups today aim for 20 in 2 weeks. \n\nIf you don't know how to use the equipment or feel foolish hire a trainer for a few sessions to show you. There are tons of workouts online that you can follow for free. \n\nFor diet she was all about the 'eat real food' approach. 3 meals a day. Protein the size of your hand, veggies the size of your hand. If there's a bit more of other stuff that's okay, but hit those 2. No drinks -diet, fruit juice, protein shakes or otherwise, no fried food, no processed foods. Keep a food journal if it's hard for you. A little flex is okay, but don't go overboard. Alcohol - 2-3 glasses a week, max. If you get hungry between meals eat an apple and know you didn't eat enough protein at your last. It's not about limiting food intake - it's about getting *enough* of the right foods.  \n\nThe best diet and workout plan is the one you will stick with. Don't kill yourself and have fun with it!\n\nPay attention to your core and your breathing. Pull your belly button back to your spine to stabilize your core so you don't injure yourself on pretty much any movement you do. Breathe out with the flex and in with the extension. Keep movements steady and 'rythmic'. Pay attention as you go through a movement. (I still chant breathe out, belly button back, breathe in as I go through movements. It's become second nature)\n    ",

            "For starters, you should focus on getting stronger and while doing so, maintaining joint integrity and flexibility. \n\nMy suggestions:\n\nFocus on the big lifts.\n- overhead press\n- bent over row\n- pullups \n- pushups\n- squats \n- deadlifts\n\nA solid routine example: \nWorkout A)\n- Goblet Squat (an easier, less risky squat variation)\n- Pullups (add weights once you can do 8-10 reps chest to bar, start with negatives)\n- Romanian Deadlift (another desdlift variation that’s less draining and able to be performed more frequently)\n- Overhead Press\n\nWorkout B)\n- Romanian Deadlift\n- Pushup (progress to ring pushups, one armed pushups, or pseudo planche pushups once you can knock 15-20 diamond pushups)\n- Goblet Squats\n- Bent Over Row \n\n\nPushups have a much lower likelihood of fucking up your shoulder, people often get shoulder injuries from bench press AND the bench inhibits the movement of your scapulae, which is vital to shoulder girdle health (you want that thing strong and mobile—it’s actual a bunch of things, but that’s for another time)\n\n\nSets, Reps, Frequency:\n- do three sets of 5-8 reps on each exercise. You can either pair each exercise (so rdl-pushup-rdl-pushup) or do straight sets (rdl-rdl-rdl). \n\nIf doing straight sets, rest 2-3 minutes between each set. If pairing exercises, rest about 1.5 minutes between exercise (pairing exercises will save time but will increase intensity). The rest time between each exercise works out to be the same amount, when pairing exercises you’re just doing double the work, shortening your time in the gym. \n\nDo this routine every other day with AT LEAST one day of rest between workouts. On these off days, go for a walk and do yoga (i like the Gaiam Yoga Studio app - it’s free), you could join a studio. But yoga or stretching is VITAL to counterbalance the joint compression of weightlifting. Neither are bad, just yin to the other’s yang (literally). \n\nDon’t do more than 3 weightlifting sessions per week. \n\nOne day a week, find a hill and run sprints for 10-15 minutes. Alternatively, jump rope for the same amount of time. The 10-15 minutes INCLUDES rest breaks. \n\nJoe Defranco’s “Simple Six” and “Limber 11” are great warmups for the weightlifting (once you get the movements memorized and can perform it without stopping it shouldn’t be more than 10-15 minutes)\n\nSo, in sum:\n\n3 weightlifting workouts per week. Warmup with the Joe Defranco Limber 11+Simple Six\n\n3 sets of 5-8 reps, increase the weight as you can perform 8 reps for three sets of each exercise (go up by NO MORE than 10 lbs in weight on each lift, per week)\n\nTake one day off, at least, between weightlifting sessions. Do yoga on your off days.\n\nRun sprints or jump rope one day a week for 10-15 minutes total (do the limber 11 as a warmup, for this as well). \n\nThat’s it. \n\nYou can add other stuff later, but simplicity and consistency are most important to a beginner.\n",

In my understanding, the split would look something like this:\n\n1st day:\n\nBarbell Bench Press/Incline Dumbell Press [choose one for each week] (2 warm up and 2-3 working sets with 6-8 reps)\n\nBent-over rows (1-2 warm up and 3 working sets with 6-10 reps)\n\n2nd day:\n\nOverhead press (2 warm up and 2 working sets with 8-10 reps)\n\nPull Ups (3-4 working sets with max reps)\n\n3rd day:\n\nBack Squats (2-3 warm up sets and 2-3 working sets with 6-10 reps)\n\nBarbell/Dumbbell upright rowing (1-2 warm up sets 3-4 working sets with 8-10 reps)\n\nAs for your abs and core, I would recommend you perform hanging legs or knee raises immediately after 1st and 3rd day of training. 2-3 approaches to max or as long as the time remains.\n\nIf you think that this is not enough then you can add some isolation exercises for your  lagging muscle groups at the end of the workout. This can be wiring with dumbbells, French bench press, flexing the bar to the biceps standing etc.\n\nI hope this can be useful. Good luck!\n",

The sauna is a nice way to end your routine, and when I say sauna I mean a steam room for 10 min or whatever.\n\nYou don’t have to kill yourself working out, just do 10-15 reps and 3 sets of the most weight you’re capable of lifting for all 3 sets.

In any case, you should understand the main thing - the exercises must involve a large muscle mass and not isolate a small group. \n\nYou can try a simple diet for begining. Carbohydrate food, such as pasta, cereals, potatoes, bread in the first half of the day. For dinner from carbohydrates only stewed and fresh vegetables. Chicken and red meat, white and red fish, whole eggs, white cheese are excellent sources of protein for you. \n\nYour progress will depend entirely on how seriously you will adhere to the chosen diet, exercise and rest. After a month or two, you will be able to evaluate your results, make the necessary adjustments and outline your future goals. Good luck!\n\n",

If this is not possible then perform them after every strength training 2-3 approaches to max. \n \nI hope this will be useful!",

I could not do a single unassisted pull up. I was not the sort of person people would expect could do a pull up either but that changed. I found an easier way to train by using an assisted pull up machine and increasing the difficulty gradually. It takes a while but it helps if you can track your progress.",

Almost every time I walked through my door I did pull ups as much as I could. And sure enough, two weeks later I easily did 20 pull ups...",

Ill do as many as I can with the minimum of 10, eventually more, every single day. Hopefully I'd be able to do it properly soon. I mean, fuck even knee pull ups are tough, damn; I guess that's what happens when you do fuck all for 16 years...",
            "Btw I'm 16 too and only started working out a few months ago. Now about the pull ups- start by being able to hold yourself above the bar for a while, once you feel confident doing that, start doing normal pull ups.",

You can wrap those arround your waist and hang weights on them. \n\n",
            "I've come to the conclusion that you can do pull ups everytime you workout if it's simply bodyweight. My coach got me on that and for the past year I started off every workout with 5 x 8 wide grip pull ups and my back reaped the benefits.\n\nDeadlifts I'm not so sure as you're lifting heavy and you need more time to recover... but definitely a couple of times a week is all good.",

            "10 pull ups is really good :) Do you practice any sports? We do Street Workout! ",
            "Focus for now on eating healthier. Try doing tons of pushups. When you want something, a snack, to go outside, play a video game whatever force yourself to do 10-15-20-25 push ups Before you get what you want then reward yourself. Get a pull up bar that goes in a door way. Every time you walk through it you have to do 3-4-5 pull ups. Whatever you can max out at. This will accumulate over time and you’ll be amazed at what it can do. \n\nFor cardio look up burpees. You can do these everyday using little space. And it’s great cardio and strength conditioning. \n\nKeep it simple. \n\nPushups, pull-ups, sit-ups, burpees, planks. \nBut most of all it’s 90% diet. Feed the machine better and it preforms better. Good luck my man! "

(there are stim free ones) once I get that in my system it forces me to workout because I don't want to waste money. Most of them promote blood flow which makes you look big at the gym too. Right now I'm taking one called c4 from a brand called cellucor, it is a little on the pricey side. But you can find it at costco for rather cheap. Hope this helps some. ",

Who says I'm trying to use my body to get girls or anyone for that matter? If that was my goal I'd say it.\n\nYour first post was okay, another poster was extremely rude and insulting. You didn't become rude until you started talking about Schwarzenegger and ignoring my question.\n\nYou think I'm rude because you are missing the fact that I'm my own person. Imagine someone asking for help finding the right headlight bulb for their chevy truck and every response being \"you should get a ford truck instead\". Then you call this person rude for wanting an answer to the question they asked.\n\nI have my own goal. You might have zero desire for the same goal and you might not understand why anyone would want something different from you, but if you stop projecting maybe you could help me.\n\n\"I really just want help finding this headlight bulb.\"\n\n\"You need to get a Ford bro. You're not listening to anyone. You're being rude. You don't have a truck. You have a pile of junk metal. You can drive around in that Chevy and look like an idiot, if that's what girls go for this day. Realistically you can put away $400 a month to save up for a Ford truck.

            "Hey! Go to a mirror and look to yourself. What do you see? Someone who do you love? Who do you care?\n\nIf you feel bad about yourself, do forgive you. Let you begin a new way of life. For yourself, for your happiness, your health or anything else you need in your life.\n\nOK? Your weight is not the problem. No one is better than other because of weight or body. But if you think you need to change, do it and never get back.\n\nLet me share about what I did, and still I'm doing right now. I'm from Brazil. I'm developer who studied a lot, I've the best degrees in my work area.\n\nExactly one year ago I had a chance to get an amazing Job in Australia. I was euphoric with the opportunity. But I lost the job vacancy, with no reason at all!\n\nThe interviewer disappeared before the interview! Yes, they even gave me the chance to try.\n\nOne entire week without sleeping! Gastritis. And then I get a heavy cold.\n\nIn day August 19th I wake up 4am. It was a Saturday, and I was 105ºF fever. I was fatty, depressed, sad and sick. I got tired of being sick all the time.\n\nI went to a mirror crying. Looked to myself and said: \"You are better than this. I deserve something better. Today I will change this poor life. I know you, I  will care about you like I do to anyone else who I love\".\n\nSo, next Sunday it will be one year of all this. One year of a new entire life.\n\nI can say for sure, I sleep better, I live better, I think better... My life is not perfect but as far I go more happy and easy is my life! All the difficult was only on the begging, like to jump in a swimming pool and be afraid to be cold. Don't think to much in the bad things, just do it. \n\nThat was me in September 2017 (in red):  \n[https://imgur.com/Iump9bf](https://imgur.com/Iump9bf)\n\nAnd that ones if from the beginning of this year:\n\n[https://imgur.com/BMErFW9](https://imgur.com/BMErFW9)\n\n[https://imgur.com/f76KYzI](https://imgur.com/f76KYzI)\n\nI'm still working on it and for me I'm a lot better than this pictures.\n\nIf I could, I have absolute no doubt you can do it too! Do it for the right reasons. With no shame or embarrassment.\n\nRight? Fix what you need to fix in your mind and start what you want. Never blame yourself again and do your best always no matter the results.",

            "I wouldn't really suggest anything, being I am only 16... But I find that doing a few sets of push ups and sit ups every night definitely helps the core and upper body strength a lot. As you have probably noticed. Try going to your school gym after hours and read some of the books and articles they have or even try and find an instructor. There's always good material to be found! Good luck!",
            "You're still pretty young and can damage your body if you try to start lifting too much, too young. That's not to say don't work out, but focus on body weight exercises primarily. Running is a great way to lose flab. Pushups, pullups, sit ups, crunches, basically any ab workout you can think of. Get yourself some 20lb dumbbells and do sets of those with high reps. There are a lot of different workouts you can do with those alone. Varying the spread of your hands affects which muscles you work out and how much emphasis is on your chest during pushups. Don't try to increase weight too quickly, especially at this age, or you'll end up hurting yourself. Good luck.",
            "If you're skinny with a fast metabolism, you must work heavy and eat wisely (and a lot). I'd start with a daily protein intake of 100g/day, and slowly work my way up to 120g/day. Mind you I'm talking about protein grams, and not grams of food that contain protein. There is a BIG differece. \n\nWeight-wise, since you don't have a gym nearby nor room for a lot of equipment, I'll suggest a self-evaluation: how many reps of each body weight exercise can you do non-stop (push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, etc)? You mentioned dumbbell curls. How many reps can you do in a row? If these numbers are all higher than 15, then you definitely need some weight to work with. If the numbers are below 10, you can keep doing them for a bit and max those reps out.\n\nAs a good rule of the thumb, without getting into anything too complex here, Try and keep your reps always between 4 and 10. Also, always alternate between low reps (4 to 6) and high reps (6 to 10) exercises. When you can easily surpass these numbers, put on some weight on the bars and keep going.\n\nOn top of lifting, try some calisthenics. Watch some YouTube videos about how to get started and go for it.\n\nGood luck!"

It approximates the motion of a free-weight row, but uses a selectorized weight-stack or plate-loaded machine. Many such machines also allow you to choose between different grips and grip widths. Machine rows are often done for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body or back-focused portion of a workout.",

After that I do flys on the cable machine to do targeted chest work outs. The next day I do legs, shoulders, and lats. I do leg extensions, leg curls, squats, legs press, lat pull downs, shrugs, and shoulder press. I repeat that Monday through Saturday with light cardio when I wake up and working out a few hours before bed. On Sunday I do a bit harder on cardio and rest the muscles all together.

            "So, I can do rows. I do a lot of rows. Beyond that, I have nothing to do to work out my back. My buddy gave me one of those things you hang in a door way and do pull ups on... but, that is the most unsafe feeling ever. I can do pull ups, but I am almost 300 pounds. I'm not breaking my house to use that thing. I'd like to buy a pulldown machine, but I can't afford $300 right now. Nor do I have a vehicle (or patience) to deal with Craig's list people. So, I was wondering: are there other exercises I can work into my routine? I have a bench, an exercise ball, and free weights. All great for pushing exercises, not so great for pulling exercises. Are there exercises I can do with those things? Or is there a really cheap home machine I can buy somewhere?\n\nEdit: I suppose I should clarify: I want to attack my upper back. Rows, deadlifts, good mornings all hot the lower and mid back. ",
            "If you are looking to put some muscle on your back muscles and really expand your lats then you most definitely at some point will be doing lat pull downs.  Despite being a machine exercise there lots things that can go wrong in executing this exercise properly!\n\nSmall body adjustments make a world of difference in any exercise and a requirement for any lifter for proper muscle building!  This tutorial will go over the technique i use that i have learned from other seasoned veterans to maximize your gains on the lat pull downs!\n\nIf you have your own input or would like to add something to the conversation you are more then welcomed to!\n"

There are tons of tips on youtube about this, and I really hope you start your journey to pullups and beyond, because personally, I think they are the best exercise for the upper body, period.

            "I would say then that the most optimal routine is one to best  develop general strength to combat things like muscle imbalances, posture, core strength, preventing lower back pain. If you have never lifted, the general principle is to make sure you focus on compound movements like the squat, deadlift, bench while throwing in some accessory work( pull ups, leg curls, etc, just to give some examples)  in order to hit your major muscle groups( legs, back, shoulder, chest) while developing a good foundation of general strength! The best ways to do this is full body three times a week to start. But you do not have to restrict yourself to this type of routine. Doing full body just gives you your bang for your buck because you get to basically hit your major muscle groups three times a week ( while working on form, being consistent at the gym). As with any workout routine, your diet, recovery and mental health will play huge roles. I am actually on a project right now on helping novice lifters get started! Lets stay in contact!"

Turned out I had an autoimmune condition that slowed my metabolism so got pretty off track. 2 months ago, I started following a lifestyle change  with the help of a endocrinologist (hormone doctor) to allow it to heal and the weight dropped off on it's own. \n\nI know that it order to build mass you need to have a really high caloric intake and eat lean so since I am cutting, I am not expecting any miracle gains, but I feel if I don't go mass building excercises I don't get any  gains or may loose muscle with the cutting (my genetics, kinda suck)\n\nThanks for reading this and if you have any suggestions that would be greatly appreciated. \n\n",

I can slightly see the muscle definition showing through, but only towards the top just below my chest. My overall goal is to try to build a little muscle and tone up. Mainly my biceps/pectorals/abs. Does anyone have any tips on what I could to to achieve this goal and lose weight to build muscle overall? I'm personally fine at 150, I think that's a good weight for somebody my height(5'11\"-6'), however I'd like it to be muscle weight and not fat.

I imagine if you don't workout enough you gain weight, rather then build. So do I need to work out excessively to keep up with the amount of food I'm eating.

Having an adequate amount in your diet can help you feel full longer, which it turns helps control your appetite. As for replacing meals, it really depends on what kind of protein you have. There are meal replacements available, set on the goal to losing weight, but most are taken in between meals, or after workouts. \nAnd for a bit of extra advice, instead of focusing on just all cardio, try throwing in some HIIT exercises as well.

Work different muscle groups on different days and stretch out after workouts. ",

You need to do 3, 4 different exercises for each muscle group. Don't skip leg day!\n2) Eat right (muscles need to come from somewhere. That somewhere is food. You need to eat a lot). Drink plenty of water. \n\nThis should help: http://users.telenet.be/WBtE/cunning.html\n\n3) Sleep eight hours a night. That's when the growing happens.

            "Well, just starting out you don't want to lift heavy whatsoever. So just keep everything light and work on your stability because you will be pretty wobbly at first as was I. The regiment that helped me the most was splitting it up into three days: push, pull, and legs. Throwing abs and other various side workouts in there. But I can't exaggerate enough how important it is to rest. Make sure your body is rested before you repeat that day again (if you did push make sure you aren't sore at all when you do it again). You build muscle on your days off, when you're resting. Also protein is extremely important for building muscle. Its recommended to take 1 gram per pound if body weight per day, so for you take 150g of protein per day. Protein feeds your muscle, I usually take 3 shakes per day and various other meets for extra protein.\n",

In my experience, those who see the best results from p90x are people who already have a solid foundation of muscle covered by excess fat.  This is usually past athletes, gym rats who focus mostly on powerlifting or people that are about 20-30lbs overweight.  \n\nThose who are already super skinny or super overweight will struggle to stay motivated because their results will be less noticeable.

I didn't feel more energized or like I was gaining more muscle. Whey protein absorbs in under 30 minutes if you take it within an hour after working out and will significantly increase your lean muscle mass which in turn helps your metabolism burn more fat. More muscle = more fat burn even when resting. \n\nAlso take a multivitamin. It's crazy how much these will help with energy and recover.

That is when cutting would come into play where you would cut your calories a bit each day from your BMR (google this) and then you will slowly lose that fat while retaining most of the muscle. So to answer question, if you are just starting I would personally bulk like crazy, be amazed at the strength you gain, workout as much as POSSIBLE a day...(the more you do it the more you will gain man) and just try to get big. This is my personal experience. I first stared working out while also toning (usually called cutting) and I did look amazing compared to before. However, when I started upping my calories from 3000 to 5000 a day and working out 2 hours a day, I increased my strength tremendously. Deadlifts increased, bench press, etc. now if I decide to cut my fat with a very productive and lean cut, I'm going to be able to keep most if not all of those strength gains while having a toned body!",

            "Hello! First of all I noticed a controversial moment in your training program that could lead you to a plateau state. I suggest you change the pairs of muscle groups in your workouts. You can try to train the antagonists in the same workout. I think shoulder and abs are not the best combination at all. Shoulders should be combined with a large muscle group for a sufficient amount of anabolic growth factors. Lower back and Legs in the same workout can create too much stress for the nervous system and muscles. It seems to me quite likely that you just do not have enough time to fully recover. This may be the main reason for the onset of the plateau.\n\nHeavy working weights with low reps can create more anabolic factors for the growth of your muscles. On the other hand, a small number of repetitions will not allow you to use all the muscle mass muscle and fully load the muscle group. Based on this it is necessary to combine force approaches with high reps mid-amplitude approaches.\n\nIn general the number of reps doesn`t make any difference for experienced athlete. It is important to learn how to load the target muscle for a certain time which is allocated to the approach.\n\nGood Luck!",

The more weight your body has to carry around the more likely it will hold onto muscle to carry that weight. Also, having more fat lubricates the joints and provides a more stable base. This will allow you to lift heavier which leads to more muscle gain. \n-It's easier to lose weight when you have muscle. Muscle is metabolically expensive. This means that the more you have, the faster your metabolism will be. This will make it easier to lose weight in the long run.\n-Being a little overweight with a muscular frame looks better than skinny fat. Muscle is what gives your body shape and what makes it look good. If you put on the muscle first you will look good throughout the entire cutting process. If you cut the fat first and then put muscle on later you won't look really good until you put the muscle on later which is further down the line. I'd also like to add that most people I know who have cut first were too scared to put the muscle on later in fear that they will get fat again. \n\nThe only reason I would suggest prioritizing fat loss over building muscle first is if you have serious health issues that need to be dealt with immediately.

When you land that muscle performs an eccentric contraction to absorb the shock of the impact. It’s a very small muscle and even though it is built solely for endurance it does wear. If you’re having problem with shin splints the most likely cause is overuse/overtraining (yes despite what CT Fletcher might tell you overtraining does exist). The result if you continue to push through this pain are muscle/ligament tears and potentially even hairline fracture of the tibia. While controlling variables like shoes/running surfaces can help with shin splints proper programming is the best answer. You need to give those muscles more rest and scale back your running program. If your shins are what are limiting you then you have to design your progression around how much you can do without them hurting.

When I do my biceps, I only do my biceps and nothing else. If I do decide to work more than one muscle in my workout, it's only one other muscle. So like I would have a bicep/back day or something along those lines. Still though, I have mainly only focused on working one muscle at a time. My workouts focus on the form and not weight, so I usually use 20 lb dumbbells with little to no breaks. I have a variety of moves with my dumbbells and bench and I workout for 30-35 minutes.

            "He's partially right - there is some time-sensitive information and clarification you should consider.\n\nWhat I believe he's actually referring to is protein synthesis.  This is where when you lift heavy, you break down your muscles (you create micro tears in the fibers).  This leads to DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) which is the soreness you feel after a workout.  Eating protein does help in repairing your muscles but only for a limited amount of time.  It's generally accepted that this process doesn't last longer than 48 hours (for natural lifters).  So what does this mean?  Here are a few tips:\n\n1. Soreness shouldn't be used as a guage - whether you feel sore afterwards or not has no bearing on this process - you body will synthesize protein whether you're sore or not.\n2. You should hit each muscle group (chest, legs, back, shoulders, arms) at least 2 times per week.\n3. Steroids increase the protein synthesis window but also speeds up the synthesis process allowing for more protein to become muscle.\n4. Don't focus solely on eating protein, be sure to eat carbs for energy and fats for your nervous system.\n\nThis is  very general, but I hope you get the idea.  Be sure to get good rest too since you don't build muscle in the gym - you build it in your sleep after a good work out.",

            "I agree. There is also a good book called Leaner Bigger Stronger which is based on the science of building lean muscle. And a fantastic YouTube channel called AthleanX. They have tons of training and nutrition vids.  Jeff is the man. ",
            "I have/had almost the exact same measurements as you. I’m 6’4 and was 229lbs (currently at 189 and much leaner than before) before starting to workout. In my opinion, cause I’m by no means a personal trainer, is to just start working out. If you kind of know a bit about lifting and nutrition, then you’ll get what I’m saying. When I started out when I was 229lbs all I did was drastically cut calories and do a bunch of cardio with average weight training.... this is not something I recommend. What I personally recommend is eat at a caloric maintenance and or just below maintenance for a while. Reason being you’ll have your noobie gains, the size and strength gains you get when first starting out. By eating at maintenance and or just below, your body goes into a “recomposition” period where you’ll lose fat and gain muscle but since you’re eating at or just below caloric maintenance, your body will use fat for fuel and optimize muscle growth. If you know what bulking and cutting is, don’t cut first. Bulk, just bulk at a caloric maintenance. This is because if you just start trying to lose weight drastically, you’ll have minimal noobie gains, you’ll lose a bunch of fat, and be stuck looking like a sickly skinny twig. Bulking on the other hand (for a couple months) will benefit you because you’ll put on good lean muscle for a while. This way when you do cut down, you’ll have lean muscle to show for after. May seem like it’ll take longer than you like to get to what you want, but much worth it in the end. One tip, just don’t cut calories too low when cutting, cause then you’ll lose the hard earned muscle you just gained. ",
            "I use myfitnesspal and it works great! Caloric maintenance is the amount of calories you need to eat each day to weigh the exact same amount as you do at this moment. Eat more than your maintenance and you gain weight (both muscle and body fat), but eat less than your maintenance and you lose weight (also both muscle and fat with the exception of your noobie muscle gains for the first 6 months). Look up online your “TDEE”. Stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure, this is the amount of calories you burn a day. Google a “TDEE Calculator” Be honest in the activity questions for the quiz. If you lie, it throws your results off. The TDEE quiz is just an estimate. ",
            "You should also drink a protein shake a day.  I am 5 10, 140 and tried those mass gainers for awhile and saw some gain with my workouts.  However I read that it's better to use a whey protein and mix with real food to get better results.  I'd be interested what others have to say about protein shakes (what to take, when to take them) to supplement your calories and protein intake to build muscle mass",
            "&gt;Hi guys,\n&gt;\n&gt;My friend and I are working on a workout supplement that can help everyone with muscle gain and recovery.\n\n[Here's the supplement scene from \"Bigger, Stronger, Faster\"](https://youtu.be/WvsHaKgcH2Q)",
            "It sounds like you need a routine that is both cardio based and resistance training based. The cardio will help your lungs recover from the years of smoking. It will also help you lose fat to some degree. If you’re 25 you really shouldn’t have any trouble jogging. Walking really isn’t worth the time at your current age/weight especially if you’re already walking all day. Biking works too. The only issue with biking is that since it’s only lower body, you have to work extra hard to burn the same amount of calories. Also, yes you will lose size (if you want an explanation of why, I’ll leave it at the bottom of this reply). \n\nAs for resistance training, kettlebells are a decent option. They are kind of limited in terms of the amount of exercises you can do. However, most of those exercises are full body and very efficient. If you have the ability to join a gym I’d recommend it as it will open up your options and help keep things interesting. \n\nAs for the protein shakes, no they are not required. However, you will need to increase your protein intake if you want to build muscle. Especially, if you are in a caloric deficit which you will need to be to lose weight. Protein shakes are a good option for beginners because they’re a guaranteed way to make sure you get your protein on a daily basis. But they can be rough on your digestive system and eating real foods is arguably healthier. I like to just make sure I eat meat multiple times per day and I usually hit my daily protein requirement. \n\nBack to cycling causing “muscle loss”. There are two types of muscle fibers, type 1 and type 2 (technically there’s actually 3 types, one in between but it’s easier to conceptualize just thinking about the two types.) Type 1 muscle fibers deal with endurance. They are very dense meaning they are small. Type 2 deal with power and they are large. So what happens when you do a lot of endurance training is the type 1 fibers hypertrophy while the type 2 fibers atrophy. This leads to a net decrease in overall size even though you’re still technically building muscle. It’s just dense muscle at the cost of larger muscle fibers. ",
            "Sworkit is a pretty good app for home workouts. Not a bad place to start. Definitely don’t do one muscle group for a week and then a different muscle group the next week. The way working out works, is you are breaking down/tearing the muscle fibers on a microscopic level. Your body rebuilds that muscle in between workouts to be bigger and stronger than before that way it can withstand the next workout (protein is the primary energy source your body uses to build this muscle). This rebuilding process takes about 24 hours for type 1 fibers and 48-72 hours for type 2 fibers. \n\nSo basically you can do the same cardio exercise every day. I would jog primarily and bike once or twice a week to mix it up. \n\nFor resistance training you have to give yourself more time to recover. So it’s best to either do everything on one day and then take a few days off from resistance training. Or you can split up the muscle groups throughout the week. Upper body/lower body is my favorite 2-day split for beginners. Push/pull/legs or upper/lower/core are good 3-day splits as well. It kind of just depends on how much resistance training you want to do each week. The more days of the week you want to lift, the more days you need to split it up. \n\nAs for overall rest days, you’re going to need them. Even if you perfectly design your workouts so that every day your muscles should be recovered. Your nervous system and your cardiovascular system get taxed if there’s too many consecutive workouts in a row. I find that 6 days per week should be the max amount that you should do. And you should build up to that. Start out with 3 or 4. You can sometimes get away with going more than 6 days in a row but eventually your body will need some designated time to recover. \n\nI was mostly self taught. I had some coaches help me with form and exercise design when I was young and in sports. But as I grew out of sports and really focused on exercise I had to teach myself. I mostly used YouTube and google. Then I tested everything I read/heard. If it didn’t work for me, then I trusted the source less. Later down the road I decided to become a personal trainer and major in health and human performance. So I do have a formal education with this stuff on top of all of the research I did on my own. But I will say, I already knew most of the things they were teaching in school because I had already looked it up myself first. So you definitely don’t need a formal education if you find the right teachers. Some of the Youtubers I learned the most from back then were StrengthCamp, CT Fletcher, Barbell Brigade, OmarIsuf, ChristianGuzman, and Tiger Fitness. \n\nI don’t watch as many videos like that any more because I don’t feel like I need that knowledge from external sources anymore. But some of my favorites that I still watch now are Jeff Nippard, MI40 Muscle Intelligence, Damien Patrick, and Mike Rashid. \n\nI know pretty much all these YouTubers are male so they may not appeal to you as much. I’m sure there are plenty of great female fitness youtubers out there you can learn from too. ",
            "You definitely shouldn't lift weights every single day - your Central Nervous System would burn out and you'd get really tired and lethargic.\n\nIf you want to build muscle, there's much more involved than simply lifting your arms and legs up and down - there's actually 3 things you really need and working out is the LAST thing you need to be worried about.\n\n1. FOOD - Eat big to get big.  You are literally what you eat.  If you don't eat a lot, you won't get more heavy.  Get a meal tracking app and track what you stuff into your face.  I suggest following [IIFYM](https://www.iifym.com/) to find out your macros\n2. Sleep - You build muscle in your sleep - not in the gym!  That means you also need rest days or you won't get bigger.\n3. Get a good routine - I highly suggest [Fierce 5](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=159678631&amp;pagenumber=1) and follow it to a tee.\n\nHope that helps.

It targets a wide range of upper-body musculature, including the hands and forearms, shoulders, biceps, lats (latissimus dorsi), and core.",

            "Hey everyone!\n\nI am a 25 year old female, and stand at 5'5\". I fluctuate between 115-123 pounds nowadays. I have very little (pretty much zero) upper body strength. I have a flabby tummy and butt, and my upper thighs aren't in the best shape. My legs are strong and in pretty good shape, but it would be nice to get more strength there too. My jump definitely is not as high as it used to be. \n\nMy exact goals would be to build my upper body strength, trim down, and increase my cardio endurance. I went to the gym last night and was on the elliptical for all of 15 minutes before I started feeling like I was about to get a nosebleed, and my heart-rate stayed close to 200 the whole time. I do have a bad right knee, so high-impact workouts can take their toll, but I can handle them here and there.\n\nI would like to work out Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. I have about an hour before work.\n\nI do have history with working out. I just started getting back into it after not being too active for about a year. In college (graduated 2 years ago) I walked and biked everywhere, and played IM soccer. Before that, I played basketball and soccer for my high school. I have some background working out and used to be pretty athletic (practices every other day + circuit training at the gym), but my sedentary lifestyle has taken a noticeable toll on my body.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions about where I should start? I felt like I was starting from zero when I went into the gym yesterday so guidance would be much appreciated!",

            "Hey - no worries, my man! Glad to help!\n\nDefinitely do not sleep less! 6 hours should be your goal. As the one and only \"Arnold\" once said: There are 24 hours in a day, you sleep 6, that leaves 18 left for you to make something of yourself. \n\nSo instead of subtracting sleep, think about replacing some downtime watching t.v. or play video games. Depending upon the amount of space you have, even workout while watching t.v. (I do my cardio this way, watching World's Strong Men, motivates the fuck outta me!)\n\nI recommended the morning because as you develop your strength and conditioning, I would start adding in weighted exercises, but typically I do my weighted and body-weight exercises at separate times - this is why I mentioned AM/PM. Doing this in the PM will be fine too! In fact you'll likely have more energy in the PM to complete the full workout.\n\nSo just find whenever you can to do it. It shouldn't take more than 45 minutes to get started. \n\nOH - one other thing: You can vary up your grip on pull-ups, do chins, close grip, wide grip, alternating grip - whatever you can. This will likely be the hardest exercise to do and the most taxing, so don't get discouraged if you can't do 5 sets of 10.\n\nBecause I always liked pull-ups and thought it was impressive to see someone bang out like 20 pull-ups with ease, I really put a lot of energy at the start into them. It is a great exercise to build your body up. But my point is.. I also did pull-ups outside of my daily routine. Throughout the day. I would do this: Set 1: 10 Reps, Set 2: 9 Reps, Set 3: 8 Reps, all the way down to 1. Basically you are \"greasing the groove,\" getting your body familiar with the movement and stress of it, but not killing it like you would with repeated sets one after the other. If 10 is too hard, start at 5, then 4, 3, 2, 1. You'll get there. \n\nYou can also do the same for push-ups - quick sets throughout the day when you got a few minutes. Don't go to max. Just 25 or maybe 50 depending upon your energy levels. You'll be surprised how in a couple weeks those random 25-50 rep sets are a cakewalk. Don't bother doing this with sit-ups - you only need to work your core so much, and with lacrosse etc. I'm sure you're hitting it too. ",

This along with a protein heavy diet and lots of rest! Its when resting that the muscle is being built! \n\nWith this said, building muscle is often not what people want when they say it is.

Sure work on pull-ups a few times a week spread out, but for now if going for muscle gain only do back and bis once a week...and then chest and Tris once a week. Also as I tell people all the time for those that want a huge upper body. Legs legs legs. Never skip leg day. Make that the hardest working day of the week.",
            "Perfect! Well, as far as pull ups I would recommend just jumping up to the bar and slowly letting yourself down. Repeat till failure every other day for 3 sets until you can do a proper pull up, hell research form etc. And a 10 pound bell will do for now, you can do sprints with it run with it, do squats with it, and more. Just let me know if I need to put anything into detail or if you need a regime.",
            "Pull ups is the best exercise for abs (EMG activation). If you want to burn fat, do HIIT instead of this kind of useless movements or just use diet (hipocaloric).\n\nThese claims are science backed, a quick google search will solve your doubts.",
            "You need to make a specific goal for you in your future training program.  If I understand you correctly then you are leading an active lifestyle and looking for an opportunity to develop your speed and strength indicators. Choose for yourself a certain set of basic movements in which you will develop your strengths. For example that can be squats, deadlifts, snatches, bench presses and pull ups. Take care of a balanced diet and a strong sleep. In this case, you probably do not need any sports supplements. If you feel that you do not get enough sleep and/or you do not have time to recover muscles and nervous system, you can add creatine, carnitine, glutamine and vitamin-mineral complex. I think this will be enough for 99% of the cases. Good luck!",
            "I'd keep doing what you're doing with dips and pull ups, and just add the triceps/biceps work",
            "No. If you want to be a pull-up beast, simply focus on doing more pull-ups.",
            "My top two thoughts are your diet - you may be backed up a little. But also you might not be breathing ideally for a tight stomach - especially because you are a runner. If you breath with your stomach this can really make the problem worse. You should be ‘bracing’ on your exhales, which means you pull your stomach back and up. This strengthens the transverse abdominals as well as other muscles supporting your spine and breathing. This is how bodybuilders do it. (Not the ones with big bellies obv). Look up YouTube videos from physical therapist on how to brace "

Like other pull-up variations, it builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core, but it utilizes the biceps slightly more than overhand pull-ups.

I suggest for the beginning  to focus on compound exercises that involve multiple joints and muscle groups like squats , lunges , pull\\-ups , rows . For an harmonious and healthy body you can organize the workouts according to pushing and pulling movements  like push\\-up with row , pull\\-ups with shoulder press. I would go for an all body workout for the first 2 month and after the upper\\-lower split workout . Don't forget about the stretching as well . As you get more strength , you can go for more specific training routines . Good luck !"

It is commonly utilized in powerlifting training to build pulling strength off the floor, but is also an effective muscle-building movement for the glutes and hamstrings. It is usually performed with lighter weight, and perhaps for higher reps, than traditional deadlifts. If these make your back sore, decrease the deficit and/or wear a weightlifting belt.",

            "My suggestion for weight loss would be to do high intensity interval training a couple times a week, it increases your metabolic heart rate (fat burning) for 24 hours. I would also recommend doing what you’re doing, getting involved in the community, ask questions and find out what things are. Try to expand your knowledge of different exercises, i didn’t know what a Romanian deadlift was, or what an incline skullcrusher was until i started asking around. It feels intimidating jumping in, but give it time and it’ll really start to latch on to you. There are some great fitness channels on YouTube (Untamed Strength is my favorite) but the bodybuilding.com channel has some great workout vids. Make sure to do plenty of practice on your main lifts (bench, squat ,deadlift, overhead press) before you move on to heavier weight and risk injuring yourself, read up on articles on reddit, watch some videos on YouTube, Hell even buy a book from like Mark Ripetoe or some other bodybuilders. And for the love of God don’t skip leg day!\n\nEdit: The name of the YouTube Channel is Alan Thrall (his gym is untamed strength)"

The hip and torso motion are similar to a kettlebell swing, as are the muscles it targets, including the hamstrings, glutes, upper back, and grip. However, unlike the traditional kettlebell swing, the arms are outside of the knees. This movement can be performed for time or for reps, but is usually performed for relatively high reps, such as 8-12 sets per rep or more, as part of a fat-loss or athleticism-focused circuit or workout.",

More and more \nhustlers and athletes are committing to bettering themselves through \nhealth and fitness, but know that the current supplement industry is \noversaturated with preworkouts filled with high dosages of caffeine and \nunhealthy fillers so that companies can continue ripping people off \nwhile providing supplements of little to no real substance or health \nbenefits. \n\n\n\nWith clinically-dosed, fully-transparent, and highly-effective amino \nacids and a revolutionary combination of adaptogenic herbs, Synthesis \ngives you a clear edge, both mentally and physically. While other \ncompanies hide behind proprietary blends to replace aminos with caffeine \nand fillers, we provide informed athletes honest, transparent \ninformation. A powerful 7 grams of Citrulline Malate boosts NO (nitric \noxide) production while decreasing fatigue and facilitating recovery, \nand works alongside a full 3 g of Beta Alanine to enhance muscular \nendurance so you can dig deep, even in those longer, more demanding \ndropsets. Additionally, 150 mg of Caffeine Anyhydrous injects raw energy \ninto your workout without overstimulating your body. Now here’s the part \nyou’ve been waiting for -- the herbs. Our combination of the 3 best \nadaptogenic herbs (1500 mg Schisandra, 500 mg Ginseng, and 50 mg Gingko \nBiloba) give you mental clarity and intense alertness so that you’ll \nfeel HYPED for your next set, but not so hyped that your focus goes out \nthe window. And Synthesis Pre goes even beyond just the gym -- our Big \nThree are designed to give you lasting mental sharpness and acuity so \nthat your subsequent late night grind will be on another level. \n\n\n\nAverage is the enemy -- you see every single moment of every day as an \nopportunity, and we give you the tools to pursue your ambition. \nUnlocking your true potential, however, starts with your body. Whether \nyou’re training for strength, aesthetics, or just overall health to live \na better lifestyle, Synthesis is a game-changer when it comes to \nenhancing your workouts and improving mental focus. \n\n\n\nWe know the grind is demanding. Some days you’ll feel like you’ve been \nknocked to the ground. But you’ll never stay down -- Synthesis helps you \nget back up and utterly destroy your workout and conquer the day. Or \nmaybe you just need to capture an insane pump or feel an extra push to \npower through a PR. Whatever it may be, you’ll always feel in control \nand ready to go. So bring the intensity. We’ll take care of the rest. \n\n\n",

I am not trying to take away of a personal trainers aspect and everything they do in the gym....it's just my experience that most personal trainers you will find in the gym won't help you in the eating aspects or give you very little guidance in order to keep you coming back.\n\nSo if anyone out there would like advice and has started working out but is struggling in the \"what to eat\" aspect....would gladly help for free. I just want to see those that are truly trying to better themselves achieve their goal. Hope you all have a great day :)",

            "I apologize in advance, but this is going to be a long post.\n\nIn short, LA Fitness is fucking us out of $630.\n\nBack story:\n\nGirlfriend and I just had a baby, girlfriend wants to get back into pre-baby shape and she starts to go to the gym.  I have been going to the gym religiously since I was in high school (now I am 30), so I know the whole routine for most places.\n\nWe decide on LA Fitness because the local gym I was going to full time did not provide child care (for the new baby) and LA Fitness did.  Well we got a family plan to work out and pay for childcare, (roughly $80 month).\n\nGirlfriend decides that after a few weeks she doesn't have much motivation to work out by herself, or with me, and would like a personal trainer.  No problem as we have a little bit of extra money since she started back at work from maternity leave and we can afford it.\n\nThis is in the state of Florida.\n\nShe goes on one of those trial sessions where the training manager pushes her and gets her excited to want to do it.  She signs the contract and then I was going to go to the gym that evening to pay for it because I had the money.\n\nI arrived, read the contract and it was for 12 months.  We originally told them we were not going to be in the area longer than 7-8 months as our lease was up on our house and we were going to be moving out of state to NC where our family lives for the baby.  So, we decided on a 6 month contract, just paying more per session.  Ended up being $210 every two weeks.  Expensive, but worth it for her to get back in shape and feel better about herself.  \n\nWe signed the contract April 3 2013, and paid $470 up front for 2 weeks and a $50 processing fee.\n\nWe were billed:\n\n4/17 - $210\n\n5/1 - $210\n\n5/15 - $210\n\n5/29 - $210\n\n6/12 - $210\n\n6/26 - $210\n\n\nFast forward to the beginning of June and my girlfriend gets offered a new job in North Carolina, where we wanted to move to anyways.  She starts July 1st.  So, we need to get out of our house lease (no problem) and our gym contract and her training contract.  \n\nWe went to the gym, cancelled our regular membership just fine, but when it came to the thought of cancelling our training contract all hell broke loose.  They couldn't cancel it, we had to pay the remainder in full, or pay 50% buyout.  They did not have a \"moving out of state\" clause in the contract.  We moved to NC, a club is not local here, within 60 miles of our house.  If there was, we would go, and she would continue her training, but it is not.\n\nRepeated phone calls back and forth between the GM (Harry) of that location (Cape Coral, FL) and the training manager (David) at that location (Cape Coral, FL) resulted in them saying they would look into it and call us back.  They NEVER returned calls.\n\nOn 6/26 we were billed for $210.  Before that I called the credit card company and told them I lost my card so I would have a new one.  Then LA Fitness charged it and it was declined.  On 6/28 They charged it again.  It was successful.  Then on 7/5 they charged $5 for some reason.  Each time they charged my card I flagged it as a fraudulent charge and called my credit card company (Citi) to explain why.  They would investigate for me and handle it.  \n\nGreat I thought.  \n\nThey charged me again on 7/10 for $210 and then again it was denied because I had then cancelled my credit card all together.  There were three charges on my account after we \"cancelled\" her training contract: 6/12, 6/26, 7/10.  I reported each one of them as fraudulent because I did not authorize them to charge my account for the services that we were not using.  We moved to NC on 6/26.\n\nFast forward to last week.  I hear back from Citi, they cannot do anything as we signed a contract for the services and LA Fitness provided a copy of that contract.  We needed to call LA Fitness back. \n\nSo, girlfriend calls them yesterday, 949-255-7200 and talked with Chad who was a \"supervisor\".  She explained the situation and he said there is not a clause in our contract stating if we move we still have to pay.  So if it is not in there, does that not mean it isn't valid?  Can someone clarify?\n\nHe then said he would transfer us to the Florida services because the laws are different there and he kept telling us about \"googling the Florida state statutes and laws\" and he could not provide any link or information to back up his claim.\n\nHe transferred us to Anthony (member services training center) which is not in Florida, which he lied about.  Anthony was a complete and utter asshole from the start, not able to help whatsoever and still could not provide links to where it says if we move we are still liable for the services and to pay them.\n\nHe did say since they could not charge my credit card anymore (since I cancelled it) that our account was in bad standing and we still owed $100 or so.  Which is bullshit.\n\nThey still could not give us a refund, or provide evidence to a clause stating we had to pay even though we move outside of a club area.  Anthony then started to be really upset and my girlfriend hung up on him.\n\nSo, now I have a $630 credit card bill that needs to pay and LA Fitness will do nothing about it.\n\nHelp..... anyone have any advice?",

            "I want to put on some muscle or at least get some definition, but I have a really hard time motivating. I’m a year too young to go to the gym alone, and working out in my basement feels weird, because like what if my family walks in. My biggest problems are motivating, not knowing what to do, and diet. Motivating and not knowing what to do go hand in hand for me, because if I don’t know what to do I feel weird doing my own thing. My diet is okay (could be better) but my problem is I’m still in high school, so I don’t have access to a lot of protein heavy meals, and greens. I rely on my parents to shop. \nI’d really like some advice.",
            "So a few months ago, two people that are close to me approached me and requested to go to the gym with me to train. They were not sure as to what they doing in the gym when they were going by themselves initially. I told them that to see results they would need to be consistent. Besides being consistent, they should want to make this a lifestyle rather than just doing it for the sake of telling yourself “oh yes, I go to gym” for the sole reason of self satisfaction. I also explained to them the health benefits of staying active and how small changes in their diet can yield them big results if they stayed consistent and disciplined. Anyways, they started working out with me, I gave them time to make themselves comfortable even though they seem to have been going to the gym on and off for the past few years. I tried to reach them and explain them the workouts we would be doing that day but they for a majority of the time they seemed to have listened but not cared. Their intensity I thought was mostly low. They almost have no idea of what weight they should do even though they have been on and off at the gym for past couple years. Then eventually after 6-7 weeks they seem to have tapered off, not watching their diet, and coming to the gym again for the sake of coming to the gym. I told them I cannot train then anymore because they seemed uninterested and indisciplined and never wanted to learn or be better in the gym than their previous session they had in gym. I want them to do good, make healthy choices but still have fun. However at this point I have lost all the will and energy to help them/train them because of their lack of interest/ discipline. How do I approach this? These ppl are dear to me and I try to provide as many resource I can to help them get on track but they seem to not utilize the resource at all. I’m fed up and just feel I’m wasting my time. How do I go about this? I’m sorry if this was long and repetitive but any help will be appreciated!",

The best advice I can give you, is from my own experience: eat well, drink plenty of water and rest a lot (don't skip the eight hours of sleep/night). If you eat 5-6 times a day (smaller meals, take the three meals a day you'd  normally have and split them into six meals) your body will use the intake better and burn calories better. If you also reduce sweets, alcohol and sodas that should help a lot. I'm no expert (at all), there should be people on this /r/ who know a lot better, but since they don't seem to post any advice, I thought I'd throw in my knowledge. ",
            "Why do you have to \"actually...go to the gym.\"?  Is there a particular goal you have in mind, rather than just building muscle?  Are you training for a sport or all around good health.  Perhaps you're just trying to be aesthetic.  \n\nRegardless of your goals, however, one thing you should try to do is to avoid using machines if possible.  Free weights are superior in many ways, though you do run the risk of injuries if form isn't correct and such.\n\nAnd lastly, if you have experience with CrossFit, you should already have a solid understanding and foundation for many compound lifts, all of which are used to gain strength and mass.  Try and be specific as you can and we'll see what we can whip up.",
            "First off, you have to know that change won't come overnight.  You will have what some people call \"beginner gains\", but they will taper off and your gains will slow.  It takes months and months of hard work to see the payoff.  \n\nSince you are new, I would recommend doing a pre-made workout.  This will set up a foundation for your future workouts by introducing you to moves you can use for different parts of your body.\nThe workout I recommend is here: [Shortcut to size](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/shortcut-to-size.html)\nThis site will explain all you need to know about form, nutrition (which I don't exactly follow, it's up to you) and supplements (also optional, other than protein).  You can even print out the workout book for free and use it.  The program is great, I have done it and got considerably stronger.  \nAnother thing, Try not to work out any longer than 1 hour- 1 hour 15 minutes,  Your body won't get as good of a workout and can even start breaking down muscle you already built.  Remember form is everything, quality over quantity, don't worry about the weight, just get the good reps (repetitions).  \nIf you have any more questions, let me know and I'll try to answer.",

I typically aim for 2500-3000 calories a day but I think that mostly boils down to preference. Also if you do it correctly (put on muscle I mean) you are going to gain a pinch of fat. It is inevitable since you need to eat a lot. Now like prozzi said don't eat food that is bad for you like fast food, soda, candy etc and use the excuse that you need to get calories in. You could do that but it would be an unhealthy bulk and you would gain more fat than normal. I try to stick to chicken, meat, pastas, potatoes, and something that really helps is peanut butter (it keeps you full and has lots of protein). Also like he said get people at the gym to teach you or get a friend that works out.

Wow so many things to take apart here.\n\nFirst off \"steroids\" and \"over the counter stuff\" are two completely different things.\n\nWhat I BELIEVE you're talking is a pre-workout like a creatine+200-300mg of caffeine that gives you that boost to go hardcore. Yes, those can be extremely effective IF you already have the motivation to push through (for instance as a personal trainer I'd never recommend a creatine/pre-workout mix to a morbidly obese individual who can't be that mobile in the gym yet. If THAT'S what you're talking about...sure I can give you some recommendations but I'd need to know more of your exact goals in the gym first to know What to recommend.\n\nSecond, when you mention the word Steroid that signifies illegal/potentially side effect enducing/ harmful susbtances (like HGH, Dianabol, etc). These can come with certain mood altering side effects and, off course, if you use them long enough, testy shrinkage as well as other effects. Don't worry about these. I personally have never done a round of steroids but I've had close friends that have...and when using a certain steroid very carefuly and only one round of 8-12 weeks, they had crazy gains and still kept about 85 percent of that muscle after getting off them. But, like I said, they did it for their own research purchases and we're also personal trainers/competitive builders so they knew what they were doing. But anyway, hope this helps. I would try a pre-workout/creatine combines with a good BCAA for maximum results (and of course Hydrolyzed whey protein). Gl to you.",

If you like what you’re doing, you are going to increase your likelihood of continuing to do it and create passion and a healthy relationship with your physical health. \n\nDoes your school have any classes or clubs or activities that may help you in person? If you or you family can afford some personal training at a local gym, that one on one experience about your body’s strengths and weaknesses with a professional is one of the best investments you can make on your physical well being which will usually help balance your mental health and diet. It expensive but in my experience it is 100% worth it, even it it’s only for a couple of months. \n\nIf that’s not a possibility for you, I would check out the Nike Training Club app. There are a bunch of workouts already written for you (FOR FREE) and a lot of coaching to help you through it. After each workout you tell the app on a scale of 1-10 how difficult the work was for you and it helps adapt the plan for you. Start with body weight exercises and gentle with yourself! Creating sustainable habits is more important than trying to lose weight/gain weight/increase stamina/etc. \n\n",
            "The LMAO is unnecessarily rude.\n\nFirst off, OP is clearly just getting into working out, so they wouldn't know everything.\n\nSecond, it is definitely a thing. Ever hear of bulking and cutting? That's literally how bodybuilding works.",
            "[Beginner’s Guide to Starting Strength](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLysAlJk_rr63E46OmjMuvWmqhFCzmfvC7)\n\nLosing weight is a noble goal (assuming you are actually overweight [BMI of 25 or more]). This is done primarily through diet, however. Of course, you want to lose fat not lean body mass (muscle, tendon, bone, etc. abreviated: LBM), and engaging in resistance training promotes the retention of LBM.\n\nAs far as nice abs goes, I’m going to broaden your goal to mean that you want to have a pleasing appearance. Correct me if I’m wrong. Having visible abs that look pleasing is really the final piece of the puzzle to looking good naked (which is really subjective, and the standard for men in society should be lowered IMO), and the truth is, it takes much longer (years) to get there than what you are normally told unless you are using specific drugs that are illegal in most countries. So it’s better to focus on looking better in clothing first (which means bigger shoulders, back, and legs) while building a chest in which you can place your six pack. (Do you understand the analogy?) If you are unconvinced, listen to [this interview ](https://barbell-logic.com/110-end-dad-bod-the-secret-no-ones-talking-about-with-robert-santana/) with strength and conditioning coach (S&amp;CC)/registered dietitian (RD) Robert Santana.\n\nAs far as diet is concerned, I recommend following these two articles in order: [“Should you ‘go on a diet?’”](http://www.weightsandplates.com/should-you-go-on-a-diet/) by Robert Santana and [“Cut Calories Last”](https://startingstrengthonlinecoaching.com/39/) by S&amp;CC Matt Reynolds. Don’t go on any fad diets such as keto, intermittent, zone, etc. Learn proper habits first, portion your macronutrients second, add conditioning third, and cut calories last.\n\n(Note: BMI is a good measure for the untrained population, but after a few months, you will no longer be a part of that demographic. Monitoring [waist circumference with a tape measure](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/how-to-measure-your-waist-correctly/) is going to be a much more reliable tool.)\n\nQuestions? Concerns?"

            "Hello! First of all I must say that pain do not leads to gain directly. But its absence is one of the signs that your muscles have adapted to the load, and you do not have excessive accumulation of lactic acid, which leads to pain.\n\nHere is a few recommendations completely taken from my own experience:\n\n1) Reduce the number of your lower body trainings. Perhaps your muscles do not have much time to recover and that is why you can not shift your results and fully load your glutes.\n\n2) Try changing the order and quantity of exercises. You can, for example, replace deadlift with flexing with a barbell on the back etc.\n\n3) I can assume that your buttocks are hardy enough, since you play basketball 3 times a week. Perhaps you have initially incorrectly built your training program. Again, I can assume that you will be helped by heavier weights and fewer repetitions in the approach. \n\n4) I also advise you to try to fully control the movement, do the exercise slower so you can see where exactly the load goes. Perhaps your back and quadriceps take most of the load.\n\n5) Choose free weights for large muscle groups, so you can maximize the use of your muscle fibers.\n\n3 months is not really a long enough term, but you probably need to make edits in your training program. Good luck! ",
            "Hi! You must understand that diet is the main if we talk about body transformation. I suggest that you carefully consider why and \"for what\" you need to change your body. If you can find a clear answer then half way is done here. \n\nYou must try to spend more calories per day. Use all possible ways to train yourself like: walking, running, stairs climbing, athletics etc. I can not give concrete recommendations on training without seeing and talking to you personally. But try to choose such exercises that will involve the whole body for maximum result.\n\nIt is really simple about diet. You need to graduately reduce the amount of unhealthy food in your diet. In the end, do once a week a happy day eating all that you want.\n\nGood Luck!",
            "Hello! I think you doesn't need high calorie foods for muscle gain. You must focus on complex carbohydrates like oatmeal, buckwheat, brown rice, pasta from durum wheat. You can start with 250-300 grams in dry form per day. Once the weight gain stops you can gradually increase the amount of complex carbohydrates to 400 grams per day. It is very important to use such products every day. In general, any meal plan implies its constant fulfillment. This will allow you to analyze and adjust it for yourself.\n\nThe second problem may be lack of water in your diet. 2,5-3 liters per day is the minimum for an actively training young man. \n\nFew words about training. You must focus on complex movements like squats, deadlifts, thrusts, jerks, snatches etc. Use free weights so you engage the larger muscle mass. Try to constantly increase the working weights in such exercises, otherwise you will just be tagged in place.\n\nGood Luck!",
            "Hi! I have simple answer. You should gradually reduce the amount of calories consumed from carbohydrates, on the other hand you should constantly increase the amount of exercise and spend more calories every day. It is very important to do this gradually. In general, there are many different types of alternations and restrictions in nutrition and they all can work but only up to a certain point, so you need to constantly increase your training load. Heavy type of work is great but it is not enough) Good luck!",
            "IMO We're better, we're free, and are cleaner",
            "There are no strengths exercises in your training routine, so you should not expect any progress from it. You must train with free weights if you want to increase your muscle volume. \n\nFor example: if you want to perform push-ups, you need to use additional weights, otherwise there will be no result.\n\nYou need a specific training program, which will be aimed at increasing the overall strengths, which will allow you to increase your muscle mass. Also important is a properly selected diet that will allow you to grow and recover.\n\nI can only recommend you to consult a specialist to start training and serious work. Good luck!",
            "If you do not use pharmacology, then there will be enough 2 approaches in heavy basic movements such as bench press. You can also reduce the number of isolating exercises if you feel a lack of strength. But if your goal is burning subcutaneous fat, then you need to try to increase the number of approaches, which will increase the volume of training and the amount \"burned\" of calories.

            "I am looking to switch up my workout routine which is the following \nMonday: chest biceps abs\nTuesday: rest\nWednesday: back triceps abs\nThursday: rest\nFriday: legs shoulders abs\nWeekend:rest\n\nI have been doing this for a couple of months now and I've seen some progress but not as much as I would like. I want to switch my routine up to something more intense. I was thinking of condensing it and doing my 3 different splits 3 days in a row and then resting for 2 days then repeat. So each week I would be in the gym different days because of the inconsistency. Would this be a good idea or does it not allow enough time for rest etc...?",
            "I'm technically a newbie also except that I've worked out for over 2 years(when I was 16) and basically just set goals of maxes for every 2-3 months. \n\nThe soreness dimishes as you work out more often and you just need to workout different muscle groups daily. \n\nHere's an example, I'm 6'3, 225lbs and 2 months ago I got back into going to the gym almost daily. I set a goal of dead lifting 3x 45's a side and I only got 2 weeks left, I'm already at 2x 45's + 1x 35 but can't quite do 3 full reps of 3x 45's. My routine has been arms/abs/deadlift on monday,legs/abs on tuesday, chest/abs/deadlift on wed, shoulders + light weight on increasing the smaller muscles around my knees/hips on thurs, and start all over again on thurs. \n\nFor my work outs, depending on the muscle group, I do different sets. The best for me is 8x3 but I generally mix it up. For my biceps, I do an upside pyramid, starting at 10 reps and go up in weight and down in reps. For my deadlifts, I'd do 8x3 w/ heavier weights and the next time I'd do 9x3, w/ heavier weights each time and the following deadlifts would be the upside down pyramid.\n\nMy next goal is benching 3x 45's a side but I've never had an easy time w/ bench pressing so it will probably take me 5 months.\n\nAnyways, there will be more experienced guys who will post but I thought I'd add my 2 cents to get you started. \n\nPs- getting \"jacked\" is over rated. Being strong like an ox on roids is cool. It's actually sad going into to gyms and seeing how big guys can get but can't lift all that much.\n",

It takes a couple months so don't rush it and don't burn yourself out.  You'll find a rhythm that works for you.  As for food.  Carbs before a workout and protein after.  The carbs will give energy and the protein will help with muscle.  Last, don't be afraid to join a gym.  Not a single person in their is judging you.  We all started at the same weak ass point.

        "Description": "Weighted back extension The weighted back extension is an exercise targeting the spinal erectors, as well as the glutes and hamstrings. Back extensions are often done for high reps without weight, but when done with weight, they can be an excellent accessory movement for deadlift strength as well as an overall posterior-chain strength builder. Because your back is the limiting factor, it's still an exercise that is usually done for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or higher. You can weight it with a plate or by holding a dumbbell or other weight in your hands.",

            "Don’t worry about the reps/sets too much. Heavy weight will build strength. High volume will build endurance. Both will build size. The only two things that really matter are progressive overload and being in a caloric surplus. \n\nProgressive overload means that over time the intensity is increasing. It doesn’t matter if it’s volume, weight, or duration that you’re increasing. As long something is increasing while the other variables either stay the same or also increase. \n\nCaloric surplus just means that you’re taking in more calories than you’re using. If your weight isn’t going up then you’re not eating enough. It’s that simple. Weigh yourself every day and if after a week the weigh ins are still the same then you need to add more food to your diet. At your body weight you really don’t need to worry about eating super clean. Especially if you’re training hard and getting enough protein. Just eat whatever you can get down. A good tip here is you should never be hungry. If you’re hungry then you’re behind on your meals. ",
            "This is the one thing most people trying to lose weight forget: it takes a while. \n\nAn example (this is what I’m doing myself):\n\nI’m ~6’1” and supposedly burn 2000 calories everyday naturally. \n\nI’ve reduced my caloric intake to ~1500 a day so there *should* be a 500 calorie deficit which means that my body will use those calories for fuel, which in turn means I’ll be burning calories that I don’t replace. \n\nThis is the basis of losing weight. We all know this. \n\nNow, to lose 1 pound of fat you must burn ~3500 calories. If I’m at a caloric deficit of 500 a day then it will take 7 days to lose that pound. From here it’s just basic math:\n\nIf you want to lose 10 pounds it will take 70 days, which is ~2 months and 10 days. \n\nHere’s what I’ve done for the past 2 months and it’s worked well:\n\nLimit alcohol consumption to once every 2 weeks. Have a few beers or glasses of wine. \n\nGo to the gym ~5 times a week and get your heart rate up over 130 for 30 minutes each time. Then lift weights like this: \n1. First set, low weight for 20 reps\n2. Second set raise weight so you can do 12-15 reps\n3. Third set raise the weight so you can do 8 reps\n4. Forth set drop the current weight in half and stop counting reps. Just do them with good form until the burn gets too uncomfortable\n\nBased on this routine you should burn between 450 and 550 calories each time which is roughly an extra 2,450 calories a week. \n\nSo, to add it all up... Burning 850 calories a day (500 deficit plus 350 workout) will lose that 10 pounds in ~40 days, and you’ll be growing your muscles at the same time which will in turn make you look more cut. ",
            "Just started my change up yesterday. Went from heavy low reps to now about 40-50% max for more reps, the high amount of reps is making me feel better about my lifting because it’s slightly easier until the end or final few sets. I’ve also been on a plateau for some time now so I became bored with it all. Also adding in something like weighted ball slams or pushing a sled or using big ropes to keep the heart rate up between sets. ",

            "Yeah 3 meals a day with only one of them being large. That’s definitely not enough if you’re a young, active, ectomorph. My suggestion is to start by adding a mass gainer (one before you go to bed and one with breakfast if you want to have 2). On top of the mass gainer you also should add a 4th and possibly 5th meal. \n\nTrust me, as a kid who used to be 130-135 throughout all of high school who “couldn’t gain weight” even though “I eat large amounts of food”. You think you’re eating a lot because you’re full at the end of some of your meals. But if you aren’t gaining weight, then you aren’t eating enough. It’s that simple. Add more snacks in between meals and you need to eat a large amount each meal. If you’re ever hungry throughout the day, you’re behind in meals. You should never be hungry except for right when you wake up. ",
            "No worries we all were there at one time, what I meant to say was if 75lbs is my maximum weight I can do with tricepsI work my way up in weight towards that max without doing it.

Example being if 75lbs is maximum weight I can on triceps what I want to do is build myself up towards that maximum weight such as first rep @ 45lbs, second rep @ 55lbs, third at 65lbs and then make the last rep under the 75lbs maximum weight you will be able to build muscle/strength to eventually make your old maximum weight of 75lbs a new rep and then 85lbs will be your next goal. ",
            "Ohhh so for each set you move up in weight? So don’t start your sets at your max weight?",
            "Depends on your goals. 3-4 sets is standard. High weight low reps (3-8) for building muscle. Lower weight and higher reps (10-20) for weight loss. \n\nGoals first. Diet second. Gym third. ",
            "Yea I would def consider bumping up the weight. If you’re doing 50 reps of something that isn’t very strenuous on your muscle it won’t do much.  Bump up the weight to were you are struggling to get 10-12 reps. I’m not a fan of finding you’re 1 rep max and then going to 60-70% of it as a beginner because some excersize will be tough to find that without a spotter. \n\nBut I also do agree with the person saying that just because you aren’t sore doesn’t mean you aren’t working your muscle. I work out regularly and I’m rarely sore the next day. Only when it was a very intense workout and really pushing my limits, or just not getting enough water in the day before.",
            "If you are looking to just lose weight from personal experience I can say that running, biking, and swimming are really good ways to lose weight. I think one of the most important things is to eat in caloric deficit so you aren't giving your body more fuel than it needs. I would recommend starting off with a 200-300 deficit then adjust based on how you are feeling. You have a bigger deficit if you feel like you can handle it but I would avoid going too low.  \n"

So far, things have gone quite well. At my heaviest, I weighed around 325 lbs., but am currently about 250 lbs. My diet is okay-- honestly, it isn't perfect but I know what needs to be changed.\n\nMy gym routine seems to have worked for weight loss as well, but as of late, my schedule hasn't allowed me to stay for as long as my routine typically takes (50mins to an hour). In addition, I've noticed my morale slipping as the routine begins to feel more monotonous. I'll leave the routine down below, and if you guys have any advice on what I can do to change things up while still doing enough to lose weight healthily, I'd so appreciate it.\n\nI also feel I should note here that I started doing this routine under the guidance of a worker at my school's gym.\n\n**Moderate intensity day**\n\n1. .5 mile jog\n2. 2000 meter row (on 7 resistance)\n3. 3 sets of 20 on 3 different machines (these change depending on what I'm working on, but I do have 3 set machines I use for each group, if that makes sense)\n4. 2000 meter row (on 7 resistance)\n5. .5 mile jog\n\n**High intensity day**\n\n1. .5 mile jog\n2. 1000 meter row (on 9 resistance)\n3. 3 sets of 10 on 3 different machines (with increased weight)\n4. 1000 meter row (on 9 resistance)\n5. .5 mile jog"

The diet should have enough protein and complex carbohydrates. You should choose low-fat food and add vegetable fats from nuts, seeds and oils. Chopping food for 4 or more meals can help you eat more. If the goal is also to get rid of the fat layer, then the last meal should contain a minimum amount of carbohydrates. In that case, you should take care of a nutritious breakfast the next day. You should also drink at least 2 liters of clean water every day. \n\nRemember that the most important thing is to adhere to a certain regime for one to two months after which you can evaluate the result and make the necessary adjustments in the nutrition and training program.

            "So, I'm a 15yo guy (5'8\") that just realised he's a fat fuck and that he needs to do something about it. This time, I'm really determined to change my physique. I don't really have much at home: some light dumbbells my mum uses (3kg) and a 6kg kettle bell. I'm a machinist in my free time and have a 25kg anvil fairly sized for me to curl it. I don't know where to begin as I have a fair amount of muscle, just too much fat. I acknowledge that I drink too much coke and eat too much chocolate but I'm willing to sacrifice that sort of shit. \n\nI find it difficult to do some body weight exercises like push-ups and pull-ups because I'm 70 something kg. My goal is to lose as much fat as possible to see definition in my muscles but to also build more muscle. I eat fairly healthy food for dinner everyday and don't eat too much at school. I have dry cereal for breakfast as I absolutely hate milk. Please give me some advice as to where to start my journey. Be advised, I don't want to spend anything so a workout with the kettle bell until I can do body weight stuff properly would be good.\n\nThanks,\n\nM.",

They are extremely challenging but incredibly effective and can be done in approx 20-30 mins.  It is much more effective than running long distance or other endurance type exercises for burning fat.  Also cut out all the bad stuff in your diet and portion control.  All this will take time like it took time to put on the fat.  You have to change your lifestyle and your relationship with food.  Read lots about sports nutrition (because they don’t promote fad diets). Check out YouTube site AthleanX.  Loads of good educational videos."

If you just workout your arms for a couple years, they will look silly when compared to your chicken legs.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI would recommend creating some sort of simple \"split\", where you workout upper body one day and lower body another day. Workout 3-4 days a week and rest on the other days. Focus on compound exercises that work a lot of muscle groups at once. Think bench press, pull ups, and squats. Once you have a solid base of fitness and are more comfortable in the weight room, then you can start creating a program that is more tailored to your goals.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI just of just threw a random assortment of fitness tips for beginners at you.

            "I’ve been overweight my whole life, and for the last few years I was hovering around 215-220 lbs. I noticed recently that some pants I had just bought a little over a year ago seemed much tighter than I remembered, and I figured I had gained a bit of weight but not really paid that much attention. When I weighed myself, I weighed a whopping 253 lbs. I gained over 30 lbs. in just over a year, and I knew I needed to make a change. Seeing that number on the scale...I was shocked, and ashamed of myself. So last Friday, I walked on a treadmill for the first time in years. Since then I’ve been going on the treadmill about every other day, walking for 30 minutes at around 3.5-4 mph and varying the level of incline throughout the 30 minutes. That may sound like nothing to other people, but by the end of that 30 minutes I am dripping in sweat and panting. I’ve been using an app called Lolo beatburn for the treadmill that tailors workouts based on my weight, height and age.\n\nI’ve also started really trying to drink more water (trying to hit about 74 oz. a day) and watching my calories, and I’m using another app to track that. Based on my weight and height it’s telling me to eat about 1800 calories per day.\n\nI guess I just wonder if I’m doing enough. My workouts burn about 300-350 calories per session, and as I said I’m doing those every other day. To me that seems like almost nothing, but maybe it’s more effective than I think. I’m only a week in, and I know I need to keep at it long term to really see results, so I guess I’m just looking for some reassurance or encouragement that I’m on the right track towards starting to actually lose weight. Thanks for any and all advice or tips or comments this may receive.",

            "Hi r/workout!\n\nSo a little bit about me. I'm a  graphic designer (F/22) suffering from tendinitis in both wrists. I used to do a HITT program, but any part of the workout that put weight on my wrists became impossible. I felt like I was having to sit out for a lot of the workouts because they had push ups burpees etc. I basically need my wrists to function with the least amount of stress to make money XD in previous years I have lost 25+ lbs from running but while at college I gained it all back plus some. I really dislike running and would love to hear what workouts y'all think I could look into that won't strain my wrists, but will help me to lose weight! I have a gym membership at the YMCA but am open to at home workouts :) ",
            "It's been a few years since I've worked out. I was very active in high school, varsity tennis and lacrosse with daily workouts for hours on end. Than college came and I still worked out the first two years very regularly. However when I moved to an off campus apartment it made it harder to get to the gym and I just never went anymore. In those two years I gained about 15 pounds. This past summer I was traveling for work and staying in hotels so I wouldn't even bring running clothes, which made me pack on another 5 pounds. \n\nI have a stable job now in one place and at first I would come home and tidy up around the house, try to make it more live able in. I have a male roommate though who I really like that was telling me he likes fit girls and that if I get better in shape he wouldn't be able to keep his hands off me, which is what I would like; I just need to get there. \n\nI tried to go running a couple weeks ago and I made it about a half mile before my feet started to kill me, the inside arch of my foot. I bought a new pair of running shoes and those have helped a little but not as much as I would like, I can run longer but it still hurts now after about a mile. I don't know what I can do about that? I've signed up for some work out classes and they've made me accountable to going, but they don't work on arms or abs as much as I would like. What are some good workouts to get those in. I'm currently at 134pounds and I would like to get back down to 115. If anyone has tips on how to accomplish this or maybe what I should be eating too it would be an amazing help! ",

            "Hey guys, I’ve been working out for about a year now, but recently some questions have popped into my head. So I started working out when I was 15, and now I’m 16. When I first started working out I got help from my dad, but now I want to start doing different work outs to get bigger but I’m not sure how. I’ve made some progress from when I first started but now I feel like I haven’t moved up weight In months. I am currently doing 25 lb weights for chest workouts and bicep workouts. I don’t currently do back, because everytime I do back I don’t feel sore the next day for some reason, but I’d like to start. For triceps I use dumbbells ranging in weight from 15-30 depending on the workout. I normally try to get 10-15 reps maybe more with the 25 lb dumbbells. (Btw I have a pull down machine, dumbbells, and a bench, so I work with what I have). So here’s the questions:\n\nWhat are all the workouts I can do for each body part?\n\nHow many times should I work out a week?\n\nShould I work 1 body part a day?\n\nHow many sets and reps should I be doing?\n\nDo I have to diet? I am not fat and never have been, so I saw no reason to diet, but many fitness videos highly suggest it. I don’t see how it would help me because I don’t need to lose weight, but I just wanted to ask anyway, just to make sure. (I weight 125 lbs btw).\n\nHow do I get bigger??? I feel like I have barely made any improvements in the past year, and I haven’t gone up in weight for a while.\n\nHow do you know what weight to use?? If I’m getting 10-15 reps and sometimes more should I move up in weight or something?\n\nWhy don’t I feel workouts some weeks? One week I do a workout and the next week I do the same exact thing and I don’t feel it, and it doesn’t make any sense to me. It’s also very annoying because I then feel like I have to take a break for a week in order to feel the workouts again. (That’s what I’ve been doing lately)\n\nThanks in advance for all your help guys! I really appreciate it.",

Make sure whatever gym you sign up to has a power rack or at least a squat rack.

I would go three times a week, mon, wed, Fri, and rest in the days in between. Start with an empty bar and do five sets of five reps. Check out stronglifts 5x5 workout on youtube. Its the one i use at the moment. (no affiliation, its just the one that works for me) its a great work out and will make you nice and strong. Make sure you get your diet in check. Plenty of protein, vegetables, and healthy fats. Stay away from white carbs as they will mess you up.( look up paleo diet, or Tim ferriss's slow carb diet). Also, at the beginning you want to focus more on building the 'habit' of going to the gym and not go full out and get demotivated. In the beginning, always leave wanting to do more. Like, even if you go for 10 minutes 3 times a week for 2 weeks, then up it to 15 minutes for the next 2 weeks ect.

My workout is simple, I row for a half an hour 3 times a day and if I can't I work out for an hour. I got my machine for free because it was pretty much from the 80's and was half broken easy to fix though. I also got a kennel ball and some dumbbells for after I row.

            "Train in intervals. Not necessarily high-intensity interval training (HIIT) but rather run/walk, jog/walk on a treadmill or fluctuate between medium/low resistance on the elliptical. Start doing 50% medium intensity with 50% low intensity and each day try to work a little harder. For example, day 1: 50% medium and 50% low; day 2: 55% medium and 45% low; day 3: 60% medium and 60% low. Try experimenting with doing some high intensity work mixed with medium intensity followed by low and so on; do what feel right for you. You just want to challenge yourself and at the end of each session, you should feel like you've made progress. If not, work a little harder the next day. \n\nAs for strength training, what I find works the best for me is to take a look at some workout plans and adjust to my liking. I like to pick from men's health (women's health, in your case) and the \"find a plan\"  tab on www.bodybuilding.com. These are only a few resources but there's really no limits. Figuring out what results you're looking to attain and in what time period you would like to see them is the easiest way to build these workout plans. Make it work for you.\n\nFinally, SET A GOAL for yourself, write it down and keep track of your workouts, weight, heart rate, etc. in a notebook. You'll be impressed with the progress you've made after only a short time if you stick to it. \n\nHere's a plan from Women's Health: http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/6-weeks-to-bootcamp-fit-week-1-circuit-workout\n\nHere's a sample plan:\nCardio 50/50 high/low intensity for 20 minutes (2 min high, 2 min low, etc.)\n\nUpper body (perform as a circuit with a weight that is challenging to lift 10 times):\n1) Bench press with barbell or dumbbells (10 reps)\n2) Shoulder press with barbell or dumbbells (10 reps)\n3) Bent over row (10 reps)\n4) Alternating arm raises with dumbell (10 reps)\nLower Body (again, as a circuit with a challenging weight or simply body weight)\n1) Squats [body weight or with weight] (10 reps)\n2) Lunges (10 reps per leg)\n3) Jump Squats (10 reps)\n4) Split Jumps (10 reps)\n\nYou can mix the order so that you're doing an upper body exercise followed by a lower, just as long as you feel challenged. ",
            "My training is one body part per day (usually 5/7 days per week). I prefer to train heavy on compound movements for max 6 reps and 8-15 repa on isolation movments. My diet while bulking is just whatever I feel like eating, but while getting lean everything is weighed and counted to ensure I hit my total macronutrient and calorie goals. ",
            "any exercise with reps of 8-12 for 5 sets will do just that. OR you can just look up hypertrophy training and that'll give u all your answers.",
            "Let me explain,\n\nRep range: you will change reps after 2 weeks.\n15 reps, 10 reps, 5 reps and finally continue 5 rep max with focus on negatives.\n\nDeloading:\n\nHere the deloading means complete rest for recovery. That is, after the completion of all cycles you will take rest for 1 week with no training.\n\nHypertrophy: \n\nFor maximum muscle hypertrophy you have to keep your muscle protein synthesis at an elevated level. For that you should hit muscles after 48 hrs.\n\nCredentials:\n\nBryan Haycock, author and founder of the Hypertrophy-Specific Training (HST) method and Hypertrophy-Specific Nutrition (HSN), began lifting weights in 1978.  He has incorporated his passion for bodybuilding into his education as a physiologist and career as a writer and consultant for the sport supplement industry.\n\nFull body:\n\nThis kind of workout is implemented for training each muscles 3 times/week with enough rest period.\n\nBrosplit: \n\nAs I said before in brosplit you load a muscle once per week and the acute responses to training like increased protein synthesis, prostaglandins, IGF-1 levels, and mRNA levels all return to normal in about 36 hours.\n\n So, you get 2 days for growing specific muscles and half a week in a semi-anticatabolic state returning to normal. \n\n In brosplit you are wasting 5 useful days because you are training only once per week. \n\nVolume:\n\nVolume is very essential for muscle hypertrophy but you have to spread it throughout the week. \n\nRead the article again, everything is explained in it, it takes some time but you will learn a lot\n"

My question is a little complicated because there are many possible answers.\n\nMy abs would obviously show better if they were bigger. But even if they get a lot bigger they won't show very well if I have too much fat.\n\nOver a time period of 5 weeks, what will yield the best results for me. 5 weeks of maintenance calories and exercise? 4 weeks of maintenance calories and exercise and 1 week of a caloric deficit? Does it matter whether/how much I exercise during the period of deficit? 3-2? 0-5? ",

Too much fat.\n\nI wasn't sure whether I could fix #2 while fixing #1, and I wasn't sure whether #1 or #2 was my bigger problem. I was hoping for answers like \"you should worry about losing 3 lbs while doing light exercise and then after that aim for a 100 calorie/day surplus with heavier exercise.\" or \"the fat will go away on it's own, aim for maintenance calories and maximize exercise\". But I got answers like \"Don't give a fuck about abs\" and timelines of six months to a year. \n\nI guess this board is for people of a certain mindset, I just wanted to find people who I thought would have knowledge and searched for the first word that seemed relevant: workout.

            "Variation is often something that is overlooked by many people, but it is an important aspect that you need to think about if you want to continually get stronger. So, why is variation so important?\n \nWhen it comes to working out, the idea is to challenge your body and make it stronger. A lot of times you will see people who start a new workout and it goes great for them for the first couple of months or so, but then they suddenly stop making gains. Why does this happen? The problem is that when you do the same things over and over in a workout, your body gets used to it. Your muscles stop responding like they did when you began the workout. This is called a plateau.\n \nHow do you overcome a plateau? Variation. There is many ways that you can change up your workout. You can either start a whole new program, or you can continue to do the same program while changing out the specific exercises that you do. For example, instead of doing skullcrushers for your triceps on Monday, try doing some dips instead. Do the same thing for shoulder exercises, chest exercises, etc. Doing different things for each muscle every week will ensure that your body doesn't just get used to the workout. It will keep your muscles in a constant state of change and will increase your overall strength.\n \nNow of course you are still gonna want to do your main lifts. Bench, squat, and deadlift are the only exercises that you should always do. But, you can still use variation with these lifts. Try doing different versions of each exercise. For example, instead of doing a normal bench press, try doing bench with resistance bands. Or you could do bench on the floor. With squat, you could try paused squat, or box squat. For deadlift, add some bands, or switch what stance you use. There are so many ways that you can diversify the way you execute these exercises.

This will definitely produce lackluster results my workout split is 5 days active 2 days rest "

            "This article covers some of the most common questions I receive about strengthening and building leg muscles such as: \n\n* What are the **best quad strengthening exercises**?\n* Will training legs accelerate fat loss?\n* How do I get tear drops quickly?\n* Should I be doing more squats or more deadlifts?\n* What is the *science behind effective quadriceps training*?\n* How can I strengthen my knee after injury or with some arthritis?\n\nLet's get started.\n\n### HOW TO BUILD STRONGER LEGS QUICKLY: INTRODUCTION\n\nWhy is it that we are able to devote hours on end in the gym chiseling our upper body, but every time leg day comes, everyone either has knee problems or they have to go get medicine for their dog?\n\nThis is the real talk people, if you want a chiseled, well-rounded physique, you have to give your legs as much (probably even more) attention as you give your chest and biceps!\n\nWhat is the single most ridiculously unappealing thing about a man’s body? I’ll give you a hint; it’s not the beer gut. It’s his chicken legs.\n\nIn the following, we are going to be talking about the science behind strengthening the biggest muscle in your leg, ***how to strengthen knee after injury***, and how to combine training methods of quad and hamstring training for maximum results.\n\nLet’s dig into everyone’s least favorite topic - leg training science.\n\n## THE ANATOMY OF THE QUADRICEPS MUSCLES\n\nAs your logical deduction might have led you to believe, the quadriceps muscle comprises of a group of individual muscles, these are:\n\n* Rectus Femoris\n* Vastus Lateralis\n* Vastus Medialis (which includes the coveted vastus medialis oblique, or VMO)\n* Vastus Intermedius\n\nInterestingly enough, there is a new research on the quadriceps suggesting that there might be a fifth muscle involved, so maybe this isn’t the correct term anymore.\n\nThe job of the quadriceps muscles is to hip flexion and knee extension. This means that the quads are responsible for bending the hip joint as well as straightening the knee joint.\n\nIn order to prevent knee injury and to have a strong, rigid body, you need to develop a big set of wheels.\n\nSo let’s move on to the science behind quad training.\n\n## SCIENCE OF EFFECTIVE QUADRICEPS TRAINING\n\nYour legs are a big muscle group. Quads are a big muscle group. Think of your hamstrings as your chest and quads as your back. Would you hit each and every muscle of your back with isolation exercises for god knows how many reps and sets? Probably not, because there isn’t enough time in this life to hit every muscle in the back.\n\nThe same goes for quadriceps.\n\nWhile you might hear and read various and more often than not, opposing opinions on how to effectively train the quads, the simple truth is the same as with any huge muscle group:\n\n* Compound movements build the most amount of strength and muscle\n* Back squats and front squats are the best exercises for quads\n* Assistance movements will be required for maximum development\n* Lifting heavy once a week for a specific compound movement is usually enough\n\n## QUAD TRAINING TYPES AND THE BEST QUADRICEPS EXERCISES\n\nWe are going to be looking at two types of quadriceps training:\n\n* Compound movements\n* Isolation/assistance exercises\n\nCompound movements will build muscle and CNS strength, and you will perform them in a low rep range, usually 4-6 for 5 sets.\n\nConversely, assistance work will serve as added time under tension and will add to the overall weekly volume spent training the muscle group. These will be performed in a moderate rep range, usually 8-12 reps for 3 sets.\n\nThese are also excellent ***quad strengthening exercises for runners*** and other performance athletes.\n\nRemember, volume and frequency are key in addition to progressive overload, so you will need to abide by the lawsof muscle and strength progression.\n\n### THE BARBELL BACK SQUAT\n\nThe king of all exercises, the back squat!\n\nUndoubtedly, one of the best mass and strength building exercises for your entire body, with emphasis on the quads, hamstrings, and glutes. Don't skip it.\n\nThere are two ways you can perform the back squat:\n\n* The High Bar Squat\n* The Low Bar Squat\n\nWhen performing the high bar squat you will place the barbell on top of your trapezius muscles and you will be able to keep a more upright stance.\n\nThis type of squatting is mostly used by Olympic weightlifters.\n\nSome quick tips for the high bar squat:\n\n1. Place the bar on top of the traps\n2. Grip the bar as narrow as you can and squeeze the lats\n3. Keep the chin neutral, chest flat\n4. Feet slightly more than hip-width apart, toes pointed out at 30°\n5. Take a deep belly breath at the top of the movement and hold until the next rep\n6. The bar must travel in a straight line\n\nOn the other hand, the low bar squat is the preferred technique for almost every powerlifter on the planet, simply because the low bar position will allow you to exert more force and you will most likely find that you are stronger using this technique.\n\n1. Place the bar on top of your rear deltoids\n2. Repeat all of the other steps from the high bar squat\n\n### THE BARBELL FRONT SQUAT\n\nOne of the best exercises in the world for emphasizing the quadriceps is definitely the front squat.\n\nThis exercise is perfumed the same way as the back squat, but this time you will place the bar on top of your front deltoid and you will be holding it with a crooked grip using two or more fingers.\n\nRepeat the steps for the back squat.\n\n### DUMBBELL AND BARBELL LUNGES\n\nContrary to popular belief, the lunge is not an isolation exercise, it is, in fact, one of the best compound leg exercises in the world. It will hit you quads, hamstrings, and glutes.\n\nMake sure to do these in the moderate rep ranges for maximum benefits and quad development.\n\nGrab a pair of dumbbells or put a barbell on your back, and start walking.\n\n### THE LEG PRESS\n\nThis is an exercise for mass and it’s all about steady contraction and overload.\n\nBecause it’s done on a machine, you are able to put a lot of weight and execute full range of motion. \n\n## A CASE FOR COMBINING QUADRICEPS AND HAMSTRING TRAINING\n\nAlthough the quads do make the majority of your leg muscles, in order to build strong and completely developed legs, you need to combine hamstring training as well.\n\nLuckily for you, this doesn’t mean spending a ton of time isolating the hamstrings as all of the exercises mentioned above are going to build the hamstrings and the glutes as well.\n\nRemember, the glutes are one of the most important muscle is your body, as they will determine the strength of your squat, deadlift and will greatly affect your bench press and overhead pressing movements!\n\nFinally, let’s mention ***how to strengthen knees after injury*** as well as some other final notes on quad injuries and recovery.\n\n## POSSIBLE QUAD INJURY AND HOW TO AVOID IT\n\nOne possible injury that could occur due to high stress and improper form is tearing in the quadriceps. Now, this can vary in severity from mild muscle tears that require a bit of stretching and foam rolling to complete muscle tears.\n\nAlthough you should know that quadriceps tears are very rare (the quads have a very high-stress limit), you should always remember to stretch, foam roll after a workout and execute proper form during lifts.\n\nThis will keep the quadriceps away from danger and will prolong your lifting career.\n\n### STRENGTHENING LEGS QUICKLY: SUMMARY\n\nQuad strengthening exercises are the cornerstone of every leg and lower body workout. Using these exercises and training strategies you can strengthen your legs, even with existing injuries and ailments that would otherwise hinder your progress. \n\nVisit Hustler Fitness to find more exercises instructed by  Daniel Burford.

            "1200 is very little in the way of calories. I'd say you can even bump up your daily calorie intake to 1500, and keep carb count as low as possible and get good results. Your deads, squats and bench press also shouldn't be the same. You should maintain good form and add a couple plates up on that bitch. Most people (with proper workout balance) deadlift more than they squat, and squat more than they bench.\n\nBtw, if you follow the weight regimen you've said you've been doing and are steadily adding weight to your lifts you'll hit your 110 and toned up no problem if you're patient and I just want to reinforce the fact that you won't have a body builder's physique if you lift a little heavy. You'll be lean as fuck with a nice ass. (might lose half a cup size on your tits though)",
            "Understand that you're still pretty young. Your body's testosterone production is going to spike in a couple years and you will naturally build more muscle. It's coming! Have patience man. \n\nIf you are going to start doing some weight training, don't worry about lifting super heavy until you're maybe 18. Lifting too heavy, too young can cause problems with your bone growth. Find a gym where you can talk to a trainer. Or maybe a PE teacher at your high school? Find some one willing to teach you how to do some basic lifts like squats, dead- lifts, bench press, and military press. These kinds of lifts work multiple muscle groups, and will help you gain strong, lean muscle. Focus on form! Form is more important than lifting tons of weight. Learn first! Mix lifting with cardio. When you're learning its good to focus on free weights and lifting with a bar, rather than machines. Machines will focus on one or a couple muscles, free weights and lifting with a bar will work multiple muscle groups and will also force you to work stabilizer muscles (which machines don't do as well).\n\nEveryone has to start somewhere man. It's okay to be self-conscious, but don't let that get in the way of your goals!",
            "I believe that if you want build biceps mass you need to use heavy weights. It is a fastest way to increase the volume of your arms. But do not forget to warm up your joints and ligaments. Find any heavy thing with which you will be able to do 6-8 reps. If this thing is of irregular form it will increase micro traumas of your muscle fibers. So you can take some benefit using nonstandard equipment. ",
            "I would like to understand how you are training your legs now in order to give the right advice. In general, it takes some time to find the optimal pattern of leg training. The number of slow and fast muscle fibers in each person is distributed differently, that is why , I recommend using several directions in leg training.\n\n\nOnce a week you must train only your legs.\n\nTry to perform 15-20 repetitions in squats and 12-15 repetitions in romanian deadlifts with moderate weights. Control the negative phase of motion, make a peak contraction in the stretched position, work inside the amplitude. For this type of training, 1-2 warm-up and 3-4 working sets will be enough. \n\nAfter a week, at the next legs workout, try working in a range of 6-10 repetitions in squats and 5-8 reps in deadlifts. Your working weights in this case will be bigger, but the control of the implementation should also take a place. In this case there will be enough 2-3 warm-up and 2 working sets in each exercise.\n\nI hope this can help. Good luck!"

            "I work out at 5am with a 2 day split that I do twice a week - Day A is biceps, back and legs; Day B is chest, shoulders and triceps. The first week was tough but now it's honestly the best way to start the day.\n\nWith regards to eating I'd recommend using the myfitnesspal app to track your calories per day to make sure you're getting enough in. The app will ask your goals and set your calories and macros accordingly and you can sync any fitness trackers you use with it as well. With regards to what to eat you can do it as a clean bulk (clean foods, little fat) or a dirty bulk (basically anything and everything). If you are finding it difficult to eat enough (and it is difficult some days 😂) just eat whatever you need to to hit your macros and calorie goals. This isn't ideal granted but if your main aim is putting on weight it's a means to an end. That being said try to stay clean as much as you can! \n\nTL;DR - morning workouts are tough at first but after a while nothing beats them, and make sure you eat enough. If you find yourself not growing, chances are it's the amount you're eating that's letting you down  "

Holding dumbbells in the racked position also works the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. Because the amount of weight you can use will be limited by what you can clean to the rack position, this movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set or more. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing it with a wider stance.",

THUR lower body strength 15 mins running afterwards and SAT circle Training - training  everything stamina and strength. This leaves us time between the workout sessions. Which is needed for the muscle to grow back stronger. \n\nI noticed when changing my diet that I made Progress much faster (had a massive lack of protein in my diet before). So use those Off days to inform you about food tricks etc... atleast thats how I did it. ",

While you will gain strength through that type of training, if you really want to add pounds to your lifts (assuming you mean the big 3 of bench, deadlift, and squat) you need to start training specifically for those.  I personally have used Wendler's 5-3-1 for several years, including many of the variations, and had a lot of success.\n\nMy personal advice would be to work on getting strong by following a strength program and not worry too much about your weight on the scale as with more strength and muscle you'll start to carry any extra weight you're carrying a little better, anyway.",

And get your squat numbers up and become better at the fundamental lifts. Squats bench and deadlifts. Eat a lot of good food.

If strength is your goal, then switching to a program such as Barbell Medicine’s The Bridge or Andy Baker’s Garage Gym Warrior would be more appropriate.)\n\nBecause you cramp at 95x6x2 (weight x reps x sets), however, instead of doing a 5x5 on Monday, a light squat on Wednesday, and 10-20x3 (reps x sets) on Friday, I would have you just do 5x3 starting with something close to 55-65 lbs adding 5-10 lbs every workout.\n\nBe sure to post a recording of your squat with weight to a sub that allows it (I see no rules that prohibit form checks in this sub). Try to record at hip height from a 4-5 o’clock back angle with your feet and head in picture when you are at the top of the rep. Tag me if you’d like, I’d be happy to give you instructions and cues.\n\nQuestions?"

Think of exercises that target more than 1 muscle group, then focus on individual muscle after.  Example, day 1 squat, dead, split squat, good morning. Squat and dead’s train many muscles, then I hit each area more specific. Split squat train 1 leg, good morning back or hams depending on weight shift on feet. \n\nOr try push pull days. Day 1 upper body push, day 2 lower body push, day 3 UB pull, day 4 LB pull. Tats 4 days same areas.\n\nHope I gave u some ideas\n\n"

            "Functional training! Functional training include lots of excercises from crossfit, body building and pilates, plus having mostly its own excercises. The difference is this: functional training is also functionaly oriented as the name says, while the others types try to achieve only one goal. In a lesson, you do cardio, bodybuilding and functionality excercises. Most of the time, you combine them in one excercise, and you work with time, not with reps. It makes you gain mass because you do a lots of reps in that range. It empowers you because some excercises are power-oriented (i.e. stand still in squat position) and there are the crossfits excercises like snatch and clean and jerk which improves explosive power. You improve resistance because you do as many reps as you can (and the more you ho further, the more complex excercises become), because of rope jumps, run and so on. You improve coordination because some excercises are as I say one way i.e. you have to perform them correctly following the instructions otherwise you just can't do them.\nOnce you're able of doing the basics, you can start mounting weights and so the excercises will turn more complex and harder.\nBesides gym, I advise you walk a lot during your routine. That gives you a little extra workout that in the long term shows really nice results. I used to be very thin, but thanks to this workout I'm well shaped and most of all I can do things in my life more easily.\n",
            "Give your self an achievable goal that u can accomplish in a short period of time. Like try to squat certain amount of weight. Eventually the goals u go after are bigger and little did you know you've spent a few years in the gym already.",
            "My suggestion would be to focus on the primary lifts and not worry about the secondary stuff for now since you haven't been training that long. Worry about the big press, whatever row you are doing, and your squat/deadlift/whatever lower body primaries you are working on. Fitness is a long journey and you can dial in smaller stuff like tricep endurance later if it is still an issue.\n\nThe 3x20 and 4x20 set rep scheme worry me, especially if you are training 5 days a week. Looks like an overuse injury in the making, if your elbows start to bother you listen to your body and dial it back."

            "HIIT (high-intensity interval training) has been taking the fitness world by storm, but it's still relatively unknown by anyone other than fitness fanatics. HIIT might just be the most effective way to lose weight -- for even the casual exerciser -- so it’s worth a try.\n\nHIIT’s principle: Use high-intensity workouts to build strength and endurance. These workouts consist of short, intense, periodic bursts of activity immediately followed by an active rest period. And HIIT leg workouts won’t disappoint -- they slim thighs and strengthen legs. Try adding these to your routine.\n\nLateral Jumps\nLateral jumps might seem simple, but as long as you’re doing them in proper form, your cardio, strength and endurance will be pushed to their limits within seconds.\n\nStand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nJump out of your stance sideways towards the right side, then cross your left foot behind the right foot with a slightly bent forward posture.\nFrom that position, repeat with your other foot for as many reps as you can.\n\nJump Squats\nHere’s another straightforward exercise that offers remarkable results. To do a jump squat,\n\nStand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nHold your arms out in front of you, and slowly lower your butt straight down.\nMake sure your butt doesn’t go lower than your knees.\nAt the bottom of that range of motion, push yourself away from the ground in an explosive, upward jump.\nLand on your feet with your knees slightly bent, never locked, to absorb the shock of your jump and prevent injuries.\n\nDumbbell Squat\nStand with your feet shoulder-width apart with a dumbbell in each hand, and slowly lower your butt straight down.\nMake sure to hold your head facing forward, keep your eyes looking straight ahead, and keep your spine in a 90-degree angle to your knees.\nReach down as far as possible with the dumbbells and then come back to starting position.\n\nDouble Butt Kick\nStand with your feet shoulder-width apart and pointing forward.\nThen jump up as high as you possibly can and try to kick your heels up to meet your butt in mid-air before landing on the ground in the starting position.\nBe sure to bend your knees and flex your ankles to absorb the impact of the landing.\n\nDumbbell Lunges\nAgain, start with your feet shoulder-width apart and pointing forward while holding a dumbbell in each hand.\nStep forward with one foot while the other remains in its original position.\nBend both knees into an almost kneeling position but don’t let either knee touch the ground.\nAfter getting as low as possible, return to the starting position and repeat with the other foot.\nAny of these exercises -- or a combination of them -- can boost endurance and strength for muscle groups in the legs including the glutes, quads and hamstrings."

I do these with a 25lb plate and they are amazing for lifting the booty. \n\n#5. Stiff leg Deadlift as heavy as you can. I saw results from these within 3 workouts. \n\n#6. Bulgarian Split squat. These are also amazing. Start light and make sure your form and balance are in check before going heavy. \n\n#7. Rear lunges. I like to do these on the smith machine only because there are always way to many people in my gym to walk backwards... \n\nAlso, I like walking lunges a lot better than stationary ones for my butt. Also remember to take a big step and get your knee all the way down. I also like to do cable kick backs, donkey kicks and fire hydrants. It was also helpful for me to start working on muscle control. Lay on your stomach and try to squeeze one cheek at a time. If you can't working on muscle control may help you also.  I really hope this helps. Don't give up.

Intermittent fasting guys sometimes eat just one full meal with all their protein in it and they dont eat for the rest of the day. But i'm just being a nitpicker in case any beginners start following this as a holy grail. ",

It is very important not to focus on how you looked before, but to concentrate on achieving new results and to repel from the form that you have now.

I did not have experience of training with such young athletes, but I'm sure that the emphasis should be shifted to the development of coordination and strengthening of the your bone-ligament apparatus as a whole. I believe that classical gymnastic exercises on the crossbeam and bars and also power and speed motions such as squats, presses, pulls, pulls, jerks and snatches will do for this. You need to spend a sufficient amount of time on setting the right technique, learn how to plan your diet of nutrients correctly and determine for yourself specific goals to which you will gradually approach. \n\nI understand that in my message there are not enough specifics, but I will not give concrete recommendations  for such a young organism about the volume of the load you need. The general advice is very simple, try to listen to your body, try different types of exercise, try to eat according to plan and rest fully.

I just ran today but I could only do about 20 minutes (walk/run) before I basically died. To me, the running felt like a more \"workout-y\" workout because I am already feeling sore. When I biked for an hour, my fitbit said I burned about 420 calories, and when I ran for 20, it was 191. So my question is- is it better for me to run 20-30 minutes per day or to bike an hour per day? End goal is losing lbs and inches preferably within 2 months",

            "I run during night time (7km+) every weekday with non-frequent misses. \n\nI have started doing some early morning exercises - *as I would also like to build some muscles (not much as in pros do - I would rather want a slender physique for my modest 5'8\" body) and more importantly strengthen it and steer my body towards a better shape and yes I am looking towards my (future) impeccable abs*^1. Currently following NYT's 7-min regime which I plan to convert/extend to 15-30 minutes with repetition or maybe external addition.\n\nYesterday I felt a little dizzy/light-headed just after finishing the workout (the same intensive 7 minute). I was doing it empty stomach - completely. So I sat down for a moment but was still feeling weak. Then soon I had my breakfast (wheat-flakes, milk, raisins) and bingo I was charged again.\n\nNow if I eat before the workout (which will be in close as I can't wait for 1 hr before the food settles in) I may face problems and have cramps just like I face it when I run soon after eating some food.\n\nSo what is the best way to do it? Should I rather take some liquid diet or some supplements like energy bars?\n\nSo  basically what is the workout-food-timegap thing in this aspect?\n\nedit:\n\n[1] As a side question - What path should I follow for my plan for shaping up in conjugation with my runs?

            "Well, what I've learned from experience is that to gain stamina you have to tire yourself and go to your absolute maximum on whatever that may be. As for running, I've come to learn that sprints are actually a godsend for stamina. Of course you'd want to rely more on long distance but don't cut out  sprints. \nRun for time, not for distance. If you're done at 20 minutes on Monday shoot for 21 on Wednesday or Thursday. Then 22 some point after. Also, control your breathing! Working on the way you breath while running is a game-breaker.\nI wish you the best of luck in your Army career and salute you for being the reason I'm able to wake up, kiss my girlfriend, and be free. God bless!",

I hate it if I run stationary, I find it boring. \n\nMake yourself a rule eg \"Before I go on reddit, I will run 15 minutes!\", which would be about 1 - 1.5 miles depending on my speed. If that isn't enough you can always increase the time. \n\nFor snacking, try to stay away from Mars/Snickers/kitkat/Healthbars/whatever and try to eat some fruits, like an apple, or peppers, or (what I really like) different raw vegetables with a light yoghurt dip.

            "Shouldn't hurt yourself if you allow yourself to recover.  Muscle soreness is normal after working out.  Myself before I joined the Army, I pretty much drank and smoked as many cigarettes as possible so my first few days of basic training were awful, albeit they will probably be awful anyways, but that is the joy of learning the military's ways.  \n\nYou can build up.  Studies show it takes about 48 hours for muscles to recover, so if you do push up and sit up drills every other day at roughly the same time, you will see a pretty drastic increase in performance as long as you continue to push yourself through the workout.\n\nRunning is a different beast.  Make sure you get a good pair of shoes to run in.  Talk to a running shoe shop locally if you can and have them critique your running style.  I run forefoot striking first like I'm up on my toes because that is what is comfortable for me, but everyone is different.  I also use minimalist style shoes.  My personal experience with the shoes was different than a lot of people.  I took my 2 mile run from an average of 14:30 to sub 13:00 after training in those bad boys for about a month.  I like them, but like I said, find one that works for you.\n\nI recommend looking into interval training if you want to cut down on time.  \n\nDitto to lennarn though, don't overdo it at first, it is most definitely possible to do 100 pushups and 100 situps in 2 min, consistency and intensity seem to be the best remedy for this situation.\n\nAlso don't ignore nutrition, give your body healthy foods and it will thank you.",

Also challenge yourselves with rewards..... Things like \"If I don't do 20 or 30 pushups. I can't go to the kitchen and grab a soda\" or \"If I can't do 2 minutes straight of Mountain climbers, I'll go for a run later\"..

I was a fencer, so strength was not necessarily my primary focus in HS. Rather, I would like to build my endurance up again. At one point I had a solid nine minute mile-and-a-half, and I want that back. \n\nI understand that I need to work on my diet first. I have already started on that. I would like advice on what to do with starting a workout regiment. I know that I shouldn't overdo it when starting out, but I am unsure where my limits are right now. \n\nWhat should I do?

I could barley do a single pushup when I first started.\n\nWhat I can recommend is working on strength training to gain more muscle mass, which then creates a more toned look.\n\nAnd with your upper body, don't worry if it's not as strong as you'd like. Start small by doing modified pushups and other variations to build up to a full pushup or for any exercise as of that.\n\nAlso, Blogilates youtube channel is great! I personally don't watch her videos anymore but I remember a lot of great workouts there.\n\nFor the eating before and after, eat some sort of carb with protein (for me that's a fruit/rice cake with peanut butter) before and eat some protein source after (I like greek yogurt with honey).\n\nAnd for workout recommendations, I'm assuming you are working out at home which is great! I like FitnessBlender strength workouts but if Blogilates has strength workouts (which I'm pretty sure she has) then do hers!\n\nGood luck on your fitness journey, you got this!"

If you have hit a plateau or are just tired of the same old 2-mile jog on a treadmill, interval training will bring you new and improved results.

The high-intensity periods are typically at or close to maximum exertion, while the recovery periods may involve either complete rest or activity of lower intensity. A major bonus: it’s proven to burn more fat then standard cardio! You can do interval training on any cardio machine such as: bicycles, elliptical, treadmills, stair masters, etc … You can also do it outside in a pool, on the slopes, jogging trails or other.\n\nWhatever you choose, start with 30-60 second bursts of intense training followed by two to three minutes of training at a moderate pace.

            "Dropping excess fat whilst maintaining or developing muscular tissue is actually tricky. Luckily, there are methods to drive your system to shed fat better as energy through a commonly named fasted cardio. Lots of fitness publications as well as blog posts refer to fasted cardio, yet they are skipping a huge aspect - fasted cardio is not actually the same as [cardio](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/bodies-are-made-to-move) on an unfilled belly.\n\n[Cardio](https://i.redd.it/h0o1dpt2bwo11.jpg)\n\nFasted vs Empty Stomach\n\nIf you want to thoroughly learn about what fasted cardio is, you should comprehend what takes place to our systems the moment we consume.\n\nWhen we eat anything, that food, our system commences the food digestion process. This implies breaking down that food into various compounds such as glucose, fatty acids, as well as amino acids.\n\nWhen we've done this, the small intestine will assimilate those nutrients right into the blood stream. This is exactly where insulin shows up.\n\nOur blood insulin spikes and transports these nutrients into our cells. These insulin degrees will continue to be increased depending upon the size and combination of the food you just ingested.\n\nFor every one of you science enthusiasts, once we've eaten, we are in a \"nourished\" or \"postprandial\" condition. The moment we are in this nourished condition, our blood insulin levels are greater than normal.\n\nWhen the body absorbs every little thing, your body will go into a \"fasted\" or \"postabsorptive\" condition. This is the moment our blood insulin values are at a standard level.\n\nSo, given that our bodies move in and out of these particular conditions each day, you find that even if your stomach seems empty, it may not suggest you find yourself in a fasted condition. Becoming healthy without burning up your gains is feasible without taking pills, and fasted exercise is the strategy.",

The exact goes with fasted cardio and in case it is your very first time reading about fasted cardio, it may well seem basic, yet there are a number of warnings. When you do not have your eating plan \"kind of\" dialed in, it matters not what form( s) of cardio or workout you do; you wouldn't step up fat loss.\n\nAs useful as fasted cardio is to pressuring your body system to employ body fat for energy, not taking in an excellent diet will burn up your muscular tissue quick. I would like to tackle the (couple of) factors which you ought to watch out for doing cardio when fasted before we delve into the (many) reasons that you should try fasted cardio.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/3524d2ik8ap11.jpg\n\n[**Fasted Cardio**](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/fasted-cardio-an-understanding-in-an-efficient-workout-concept) **is Catabolic**\n\nThe key cause fasted cardio has such a bad name results from the simple fact that it is remarkably catabolic.\n\n**Just what does catabolic indicate?**\n\nCatabolism is the breakdown of particles to create less complex ones. Anabolism is the construction of muscle (anabolics) as well as catabolism is the utilization of muscular tissue for energy.\n\nIngesting a well-rounded meal packed with naturally healthy foods, using supplements, and having lots of necessary protein into your diet regimen helps in reducing the catabolic impact of fasted cardio.\n\n**Just Why is** [**Fasted Cardio**](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/fasted-cardio-an-understanding-in-an-efficient-workout-concept) **Great For Fat Loss?**\n\nIn the end of the day, fat decrease needs a calorie shortfall. People have to comprehend just how much energy you are actually burning and you should understand what you are taking in.\n\nWhile a simple calculator can't take into effect certain aspects of your health that can affect your calorie expenditure, there are plenty of tools to help you get a decent idea.\n\n**How Exactly Does** [**Fasted Cardio**](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/fasted-cardio-an-understanding-in-an-efficient-workout-concept) **Work?**\n\nFasted cardio comes with a few exceptional perks above fed cardio considering that when you remain in a fasted condition, your system raises lipolysis and also fat oxidation levels. This is a complicated word which implies your system will begin utilizing fat stores for energy.\n\nLipolysis is the breaking down of fat cells for fuel, whilst fat oxidation is the melting of this energy.\n\nTherefore because our blood insulin values are at baseline, your body is much more ready to use body fat for energy.",

It isn't ideal but ensuring that you eat but hit your macros will still help you cut down. \n\nAt the end, it takes patience and consistency, always remember that the fat didn't appear overnight and won't go away overnight either.

            "If you want to \"lose weight and tone\" then you must understand how does it work. During your workout you expend your energy reserves. During your rest period, these reserves are replenished from the glycogen that is stored in your liver and muscles. Glycogen stores are replenished mainly from carbohydrate food, so carbohydrates directly affect your energetics, strength and mental potential. If the glycogenic depots are depleted and do not replenish for a certain time, then the body will use alternative sources of energy, such as subcutaneous fat. From this it follows that your main task is to deplete glycogen reserves as quickly as possible and not to replenish their certain amount of time in order to create conditions for using subcutaneous fat as energy. \n\nSo If you are not satisfied with your current form, then you definitely should gradually increase your training loads. This does not necessarily have to be a \"cardio\" workout, rather the opposite. High-intensity, interval cardio loads first of all overload your heart and do not deplete glycogen stores in muscles. Such trainings are aimed at the development of endurance and do not directly affect the fat burning processes.

But in any case, a large number of repetitions can use more muscle fibers and this should affect the overall proportion of your lower body. Even a small increase in their volume can improve your forms. On the other hand, training in high repetition mode will help you better feel the work of a specific area and improve your individual technique. This will create the necessary potential for increasing working weights in training with a small number of repetitions. I think this should help you diversify your training and surprise your muscles with a new type of loading. Perhaps, this will improve the shape and proportions of your lower body.",

While running, you'll be burning more calories than while doing strength, but strength will burn calories in the long run, as it increases the amount of calories your body consumes constantly.",

These days I have been sprinting to keep my cardio sessions short. \n\nAny insights would be valuable. ",
            "Building strong abs are relatively simple, they heal quickly so they can be done multiple times a week. Doing them properly is key, a crunch is bringing your ribs to you hips or reverse crunch hips to ribs, sit ups if not employing that motion are next to useless. Another way to develop a strong core is to do dead lifts, or squats, your core is constantly engaged trying to stabilize itself. \n\nBut to be perfectly clear, you can work your abs until you are blue in your face, if you do not eat properly and do tons of cardio your abs will never show to the point you will like, because there is a layer of fat over top obstructing the definition of the muscle tone. I recommend interval cardio, or Tabata training to really blast that fat away. Spot reduction is a myth, so the more you work your abs, it does not reduce the fat around your belly to really make them pop.\n\nSo in summation \n\n1. Reduce calories in your diet, depending on your weight to 1700-2000 to achieve a caloric deficit. 60% protein 30% fats (mono,poly,sat fats) 20% carbs preferably from fruit, veg, rice, quinoa, cut out bread, sugar, salty snacks, pasta.\n2. Increase cardio, turn up the intensity on your workouts so you are sweating, and burning calories.\n3.Switch it up, when your body gets used to a routine you plateau, so shock it by switching it up.\n\n\n(take omega 3-6-9 supplements every day! if you are in school, it will help maintain cognitive function, a diet can really slow your mind) ",
            "Well, your workout is really all over. I would simplify it.\n\nDay 1: Chest/Biceps\nDay 2: Back\nDay 3: Off\nDay 4: Shoulders / Triceps\nDay 5: Legs\nDay 6: Off\nDay 7: Off\n\nThe easiest way for me to recommend a training routine without providing an entire wall of text, is to reference Dorian Yates’ “Blood and Guts,” videos. He breaks down an excellent routine for bodybuilding. It also goes through the routine day-by-day, so you can watch it before your workout to get extra psyched. Here is a link: http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/dorian-yates-blood-guts-6-week-trainer.htm\n\nIn my opinion, you’re doing too much, and likely not giving enough to the really important exercises, as your energy has to be balanced out for such a long routine. Ideally you want to be in and out within 45 minutes, and for me, that can even include 10 minutes of cardio!\n\nI would start with Dorian’s 6 week trainer. You will see increases in size and strength. Follow it religiously. After 6 weeks, I always change-up my routine. At that stage, I’ll be glad to recommend a more customized routine for you, as you will be better able to gauge what is working for you, and what isn’t. \n\nAlso, when it comes to exercises – take your chest for example – typically you’ll want to do all the heavier / harder exercises first, the pushing movements, and then the fly movements. Your chest is taxed more from the pushing movements, and you’ll want to use the heaviest weights you can with them. In your current routine, after your do a flat DB Press, you go into flyes, but eventually back into presses. Your strength will be exhausted due to all the previous movements. However the presses are more important for muscle growth and then flyes, so you’re cutting yourself short energy/strength wise. It is better to tax your muscles completely through the pressing (heavier) movements, and then finish off your chest with fly-type exercises.\n\nRunning twice a week isn’t a problem; I do cardio 3 times a week even while bulking. I hate feeling winded when I don’t do cardio. \n\nYour diet is the biggest issue. For starters, you should try to eat 6 times a day. That is often impossible for people at the start. So aim for 4. Do that for 2 weeks, and then aim for 5. 2 weeks at 5, and then 6. If you weigh 185, and you want to gain weight, you need to know what your base caloric needs are, so you can see how much extra calories you will need to eat to gain weight. As I don’t know your daily activity level (i.e. at work, outside of the gym) I’ll say a baseline for keeping your weight as is, would be approximately 2600-3000 calories. \n\nYou should tally what an average day is calorie wise. Sure, calories will differ a bit between a PB&amp;J sandwich compared to a Ham &amp; Cheese, but overall, your daily intake will be somewhere within that range. This is important, as then you know how much more you need to eat.\n\nLet’s say you eat 2600 calories a day roughly. Well increasing your calories by 400 a day nets you an increase of 2800 calories at the end of the week. Keep that up over the span of a month and that is approximately 11200. See – now you’re gaining weight. Accompanying this weight gain with a proper workout routine as recommend above and your strength/muscles WILL grow.\n\nFor eating, what I do is if my goal is 3300 calories a day, I divide that by however many meals I’ll eat. For me that is 6. I include protein shakes / snacks as meals too. So 3300 / 6 = 550 calories per meal. If I know that I want my nutrients to be a 60/30/10 split (carbs/protein/fats), I can then start to piece together foods that will amount to those totals. I typically start with a protein, say a chicken breast, I’ll know its protein/calories, and then I’ll build around it. Say some trailmix for carbs and fats; or a sweet potato, etc. \n\nIt is annoying to write down everything you eat, but it does allow you to track and more effectively gauge your progress.\n\nFor diet, if you need some suggestions on what to eat, just ask.",

I don't jog for very long, maybe 30-40 minutes. I even have proper shoes for jogging. I also wait a couple days after jogging so my legs can heal.",
            "Funny you say that, I love csgo. Watching freakazoids stream right now lol. Running is important, its cardio, and as you do it daily, you're going to be okay. If you have a long, decent trail behind the house, then yeah go for it. The lifting schedule they are referring to is just basically different work out sets. For instance, Mondays, try to focus on one set of muscles, then on Tuesday another set.  And so on. I take weekends off and only work out Monday through Friday. Friday's are leg days for me since its the most difficult, and plus it hurts like a bit** 2 days later lol. Just try to find something that works for you. ",
            "The most important thing you should know is that losing fat is 20% working out and 80% nutrition and diet, which I see no mention of above. As long as you eat less than you burn you will lose fat. You can do this by burning more calories (by doing cardio/interval training, and/or by gaining muscle) or eating fewer calories.\n\nNote that crunches and ab workouts will not burn fat for you (well, a negligible amount) as they are not large enough muscles to really help with this, but will help to add definition for when your bf% is low enough to reveal abs. I'd include squats or another major leg workout in your routine in place of the ab work or as well as it, as leg muscles are your largest and will aid in burning more calories at rest for you.\n\nHope this helps!",
            "Male or female?  Do a keto diet and use the bike for cardio. Do workouts that are super sets. If you don't know any exercises just look up arms, chest, back, shoulders, legs, on a website and they have plenty of routines for each body part",
            "I would readjust your workout as following for better results:\n\nMonday: chest &amp; back \n\nTuesday: cardio\n\nWednesday: legs, calves, abs \n\nThursday: cardio\n\nFriday: shoulders and arms \n\nSunday: active rest \n\nHopefully this helps :-) ",
            "Dieting is really important, I'd probably go on bodybuilding.com and work out your macros and stick to them! \n\nAlso cardio is very important to get rid of fat but never under estimate the importance of lifting weights... ",
            "Based on my understanding of how much you are willing to workout/ how advanced you are, here is my suggestion:\n\nIn addition to having a good diet (fewer carbs / leaner meats / lots of water and some caffeine) I would suggest separating your work outs to 4 days a week:\n\n(In whichever order)\n\n1) 45 minutes of yoga (since you like stretching so much + stretching does help keep you lean)\n\n2) 1 hour of upper body weights \n\n3) 45 minutes of cardio (of any variety)\n\n4) 1 hour of lower body weights",
            "I would not recommend it. Pre workouts generally increase your heart rate. The entire point of cardio is to be able to control your heart rate when it is under stress",
            "That will work. Just remember that bigger muscles burn more calories so keep the balance between the 2. Most importantly, and this point can't be stressed enough, eat healthy. You will never see the results you want with a bad diet. 90% diet 10% exercise",
            " One thing that works for me is cardio first thing in the morning. By first thing in the morning I mean even before you brush your teeth get up, get dressed, and do your favorite type of cardio for about 30 minutes. Try it for a week then thank me after. ",
            "cant you burn that in an hour of rough sex",
            "Cardio as soon as you wake up so you burn stored fat instead of calories you took in. Do that for 30 minutes a day and you'll be golden.",
            "The chest and legs take the longest to show results. Keep at it. Also keep working the abs but add cardio and you'll see them faster. \n\nPay attention to the foods you eat. There are some tricky foods that are technically \"healthy\" but have a lot of fat in them. For instance, I had Paad Thai last night for dinner from a good Thai place and it still had almost 1000 calories in the order. Also limit your peanut intake, break intake and limit drinking to once a week. ",
            "If I were you I'd try to maintain the legs, alot of guys have alot of trouble to get nice legs so make sure you hold on to them! Regarding the big arms, it's the exact opposite of cardio training, low amount of reps but alot of weight. I don't think you would have too much trouble getting big arms, arms are commonly viewed as one of the easier areas to put on gains. Good luck!",
            "I have done powerlifting and bodybuilding and always found it helpful to do cardio at least twice a week. It helps build work capacity which can help during intense lifting sessions. ",
            "Working on obliques and your traps will taper down your mid section. Also lower abdominals, assuming you work on your upper abdominals already. Try using a thermogenic and also do cardio on opposite days as your lifting.",
            "Cardio first thing after you wake up will burn stored fat rather than food. ",
            "That's pretty simple then. Do cardio for 45 minutes to an hour every morning as soon as you wake up before eating. Also take in less calories. Losing weight is pretty simple, gaining weight is the difficult one. Stop loading up on sugars and carbs and the weight will literally fall off. If you want to add strength and muscle tone to that I would recommend high reps at lower weights. I'm assuming you're trying to lose weight to pull women so go on bodybuilding.com and check out work outs to build abs, chest, and arms. If you want to get into a gym and work out I can give you my routine plus my supplements i take. ",
            "Also cardio every morning when you wake up. Don't worry about bro science saying it will effect your gains. Once you get your body in the condition you want it in you can work on muscle gains and in take more protein and drop the cardio to the ab days.",
            "Sorry just read the Syria part. No it isn't but some sort of protein in the morning that has some calories. ",
            "Imo Nope. Cardio is how much work Ur heart needs to pump in order for u to do the activity. Isometric holds are effective for 1 minute - 3mins no more than that really. Ur heart won't be working that hard in an isometric hold either. It's a different stressor that requires u to train ur cardio and planking just doesn't cut it. ",
            "Eat less calories than you are burning",
            "If it were easy, everyone would be in top shape.  \n\nIt's complicated.  Different calories work somewhat different but yeah, you'll need to count calories.  You have to consume less than you use to lose fat.  I would suggest asking a dietitian.  Some gyms offer it, especially gyms/wellness centers affiliated with hospitals.  Maybe the YMCA has it in your area.",
            "Crossfit is a good choice for you. The only issue is you need to swap out high reps with moderate weight for low reps with maximum weight or for calisthenics go for fewer reps but with slower movement. Add calories to your diet every week, try to add +100 calories til you're at around 3.25k cals /day. Eat lean. There's no reason you cant gain lean mass with crossfit, you don't have to dirty bulk and completely cut cardio, though with cardio it will be slower results as you're burning cals more so for organ function than muscle recovery. That's why I mentioned to eat so much, to try and offset that effect. Also after doing crossfit it doesnt hurt to try to get in a small regimen of lifts. Nothing big but just isolated areas. For example, if you want bigger arm, after crossfit, do some bicep curls or tricep extensions, etc. Muscles actually grow best this way anyway. If you do tricep extensions then follow it up with pushups you will see dramatically faster results than either alone.",
            "I am pretty sure I don’t have to lose weight tho. I just want defined muscles and to improve my cardio. Cardio is easy, I just don’t know what to do to get those muscles apparent. ",
            "I’m gonna tell you no. It’s not. My brother runs marathons and won’t do weight training and he doesn’t like the way he looks. Plus running all the time and nothing else puts wear and tear on your legs. I prefer to switch it up.\n\nI do different machines for 15-20 min of cardio - either treadmill or stair master every day I work out. Then rotate chest and shoulders, bi’s tri’s and back, and leg day - after cardio. After the weight routine you should do some core workout every day too.\n\nIn addition to that my gym offers yoga classes so I’ve been tacking on a night yoga class. Which I definitely sweat in, but I’m there to stay flexible and loose.\n\nThis is the ideal workout routine for me and I feel I’m covering all the bases and not getting bored.",
            "Depends on your goal. If you're trying to build muscle, don't work out legs today. If you're just trying to burn some extra calories, go ahead and continue. It'll actual help the DOMS",
            "Thank you! Though I've heard cardio isn't where it's at :( so I'm not sure if I would do so much",
            "To get bigger and to gain weight, all you have to do is consume more calories than you burn. A mass gainer is just an ‘easy’ way to get more calories into your diet. By no means will it just “work” to get you bigger. It can add to your daily calories count if you struggle to eat enough, in which case, it works. But you can just eat more too. It’s all a numbers game. ",
            "Don't focus on just arms and legs. Work out your core, chest and back as well. You can reduce fat from the waist by lowering your caloric intake. If you work out, your body will need more calories to get by so it will be a little easier to lose weight than just lowering your caloric intake without workouts. ",
            "I have been adding some more protein into my diet lately and it has been helping a bit. And yes it is really hard with all of the cardio! Whatever I eat I work off almost instantly. Thank you for the response!",
            "I can here for the same reason. I work out but gain more calories than burn. I recently had surgery and wanted to see how I could lose about 20-30 pounds the fastest way. Right now I’m just running and biking but I need actual help",
            "For cardio, start off working endurance. modded HIIT workouts (primarily used for soccer players) work well with track athletes as well, former in your case. For example, 2 minutes running high pace—&gt;1.5 walking for twenty minutes. This can be done 3-6 times a week, depending on how your body reacts.\n\nThe endurance training will help with your LD running. To get to your goal of 2 Miles, you should first see how far you can run in general. Go for distance first, then speed.\n\nWeight training should include squats, calf raises, and leg presses to work your legs (this will help build muscle and improve cardio results). Core should be worked daily, google any proven ab workout, my favorite is the Army ab circuit workout, and stick to it. I’d stress working your obliques, if you strengthen them it could cut down on soreness. As arms and back go, triceps pulls and YTALS can build your back and chest.\n\nDieting should be your #1 - eat clean, and results will come!",
            "Definitely will do, im gunna do this about 30 mins after my cardio right after that thick film of sweat is gone \n\nI'll try to remember to get back after a few days and see how i feel, ive tried a couple of these after reading your comment and they feel like after a while theyll work out just fine, thanks much appreciated.",
            "Add some form of rows to that, and start with regular cardio, not HIIT.\n\nI'd assume OP needs to strengthen his upper back as well to fix his posture, an while a great exercise, deadlifts alone won't do all the work. Regarding cardio, given the body fat percentage it's pretty safe to say that OP doesn't have much to work with, so some walking or light jogging is enough to get his cardio up. I wouldn't recommend HIIT until he has at least build up a bit of stamina.",
            "First off, I’m glad to hear you’re starting something healthy and positive! A little more than 6 years ago I was in a similar position (terrible diet, smoker, physical job... I was however over weight and approaching my 35th birthday). At age 41 I’m now stronger and healthier than I was in my twenties.\n\nSo as someone who has walked the walk, here’s my advice.\n\n1). Start slow. Add cardio conditioning 30 minutes x 3 days per week . Personally I really enjoyed kickboxing DVD’s (Jillian’s kickboxing fast fix is a good beginner , MOSSA fight and core de force are favorites), but light jogging with walking in between bits of jogging is good too: cardio will help condition you... it lays down the foundation for any other exercises or fitness you want to pursue.\n\n\n2). Once that feels good, I added some strength training. I started with a twice per week 40 min total body circuit. As I got stronger I added more strength work. But start here. I liked the MOSSA Power or Les Mills Pump DVD’s for this \n\n3.) Diet. I was really over weight. So I started forcing myself to count calories (it was an eye opener!). I also got a fit bit. It tracks activity level at work and gives you an idea of how many calories you need. I do warehouse work but lifting boxes didn’t compete w my love of pizza lol\n\n4. Smoking. I don’t want to preach, but quit. Best thing I ever did. I was really sad when I quit because I felt like I couldn’t take the breaks or go outside.... I gave myself ice water breaks instead. Every time I wanted to smoke, id make a cup of ice water and go sip it outside. \n\nAnyway , find things you like. I ended up enjoying home workout DVD’s , but try different things. \n\nThese days I lift weights following some DVD’s (body beast DVD’s specifically... love them!) and jog on my treadmill with audible books.... and couldn’t be happier ",
            "How is your diet? Abs are made in the kitchen not at the gym. How clean you eat will have a huge impact on abs. Incorporating some cardio will help burn some extra calories. Row machine and swimming are best. \nWhat are you doing for core workouts? ",
            "Equations didn't really work for me.  \n\nThe best thing to do is get on a regimented diet with all the calories counted out.  Then start monitoring your weight.  If your weight increases, lower the calories.  If it goes down,  increase the calories.  Once you reach a place where your weight doesn't go up or down - there's where your maintenance calories will be.  This will fluctuate so don't take it as gospel truth - just a ballpark.  Once you get there, you can now increase or decrease calories according to your goals (whether to bulk or cut).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that helps. ",
            "That would do imo . During my busy work and study semester,I usually do 3x full body. It’s not the best but it gives good results and the other 3 I try to put in cardio or hiit. The rest day is the one I hate the most oddly enough.\nI do like your home gym but it won’t suffice",
            "I mostly swim to ease up on the joints or walk around a track or incline treadmill occasionally. I still work out arms and core but have been wary of training legs.\n\nThanks for this!",
            "Would biking do much for my core though instead of just my legs? \nI've got a bike that I go back and fourth to work with, but the journey's so short and flat it never felt like a workout.\nI've some weights on order, 5kg dumbells, which I can manage. How should I lift those if I want all of my arms and chest to get stronger? \n",
            "I work out about 3-6 times a week depending on work. At work I’m constantly lifting speakers (sound guy), climbing ladders, and being active. \n\nUsed to play a bunch of sports back in high school, but haven’t done anything since. I’m 28 now. \n\nNormal workout week is chest/back, legs/shoulders, arms, and cardio/abs day. Depending on work, rest days vary. \n\nI can literally do every leg exercise and not cramp besides squats and lunges. Upper body stats I feel good with. Bench 225, shrug 100lbs dumbbells, shoulder press 70lb dumbbells, etc...\n\nBut lunges it takes me like 2 sets of 10 on pure body weight to get this unbearable cramp in hamstrings. It literally destroys my workout since I can’t use my legs to drive for any other exercise. Same thing with squats. If I do anything over 25lbs a side I last like 2 sets of 6, I have to hobble over to the roller and roll them out. Getting really annoyed because I know squatting is a great exercise for your body. \n\nThoughts? "

Mountain biking has a greater fun factor so if you don’t have an addictive personality that may be easier to do. You can go to your local bike shop to test ride a bike and since it’s spring you can check on Facebook with the bike stores around you to see if they have any demos in the future, which is basically when the bike shop takes almost all of their bikes to the local trail and let anyone ride for possibly a small fee and your drivers license. You can go to r/MTB or    r/bicycling  to get advice on what bikes you should be looking at, but you’ll probably want a hard tail to do cross country trails. If you want to road bike I don’t have much advice because I don’t do that, but I’m sure there are road biking sub Reddit’s that can help you out. ",

Like u/luckypepper said, you can't out-cardio a bad diet.\n\nAnyway! Back to your original question about cardio. I've been doing a running (2miles)/swimming(1hour)/biking(20minutes) rotation that I've been enjoying. I couldn't agree more that running is so incredibly boring- especially on a treadmill. I run at a pretty slow but decent pace and put a TV show on Hulu on and cover up the time/distance with a towel and only let myself peek after 5 commercial breaks. When I want to hate myself (I really hate cardio) even more after running or biking, sometimes I'll hop on the stair stepper or elliptical. Swimming is nice because after my hour of swimming I tan for an hour afterwards.\n\nIf your gym has those (cringe) group fitness classes, some of them are pretty fun. ",

I recommend selling your setup and saving up for a power rack, instead. They cost about the same, and it is much more versatile. ",

            "I was a Marine, and I have stayed very active since.  I consider myself a balanced athlete and I will offer my advise after 15 years of working out, some personal training, competing, and being in sports.\n\nYou can definitely do one day, two at most.  Squats and deadlifts will be a great focus point.  Only Do one of those, or one heavy and one light, if you choose one leg day.  Lunges, leg press, romainian deadlifts, box jumps, and tire flips are all great leg exercises that help with athleticism.\n\nKeep in mind that when you first start encoporating a leg routine, you will be very sore.  Until your body gets used to this, your running will be difficult.  This will change in a short amount of time though.  You will become a much better athlete all around when this is a regular part of your routine.  Lifting helps to prevent injury when it comes to sports or running.  Doing mostly lower weight with higher reps will be good, but I suggest to change this occasionally to higher weight in the 8-10 rep range or even the 5 rep range to promote muscle strength and growth.\n\nI hope this is helpful.  I've ran many times ranging from 1-23 miles.  I consider myself an avid weight lifter as well as someone who wants to be functionally strong and athletic.  Hitting the weights has done nothing but improved my athletic performance all around.  Have a great day!"

Your body only has so much blood. If it has to send blood to the digestive muscles  mid workout that's taking away from the amount of blood it can send to the muscles you're working and it will hamper your workout.

            "Note, I'm asking for advice but can't find an advice subreddit specifically for work out stuff. If there is one let me know and I'll take this down and post it there. \n\nHello I am a 19 year old, 5 foot 1, 105 lb female. I'm relatively in shape, staying within my calorie balance, walking about 2 to 3 miles a day just by Meandering around school and work, and I work out when I can. I've already lost about 40 pounds since coming to college. And from then on I put on a decent bit of muscle. But for the life of me I cannot get good at Cardio. Over the summer between freshman and sophomore year I ran almost every single day, just trying to make a mile in one go. It took about two and a half months for me to be able to run the mile without having to stop or walk for part of it. Even then I was clocking in about 11 or 12 minutes. Now, I'm not looking to be Usain Bolt here, but I would like to be able to have good enough heart that I can run for 2 or 3 miles. \nI know you're just supposed to push yourself as hard as you can go, but I really am. For example today I hadn't done cardio in quite some time, but decided I was finally going to get back on the track today. I was just going to try and run as much of a mile as I could. I ended up doing about .2 miles just walking and warming up. Then I went to go jog at a relatively slow pace, but could only do .4 before I was panting and gasping. So I decided to slow down for one lap and then pick up the pace again the next one. I regain my breath and just like 30 seconds, but the second I started running again it was ripped from me faster than before. My boyfriend keeps saying I just need to push through it and not care about the fact that I'm literally panting and probably everyone in the gym can hear me, so I did and I just kept going. But then I started seeing little black spots in my vision and figured that probably wasn't the best. So I slowed back down to walk. I kept going back and forth between running and walking for the rest of the mile, I would recover very quickly, but as soon as I would start running again black spots would emerge and I would be panting again. \nIs there a chance I have like asthma or something? It's never come up before and I used to be in cross-country high school. Or am I just really really out of shape and didn't know it? Is there something I can do that I can push myself harder without have to worry about passing out running in the gym?",
            "I started running for around 30 minutes each day and about an hour after my run my legs start to cramp and i start to feel like an elder and it's the next day and it is still happening my question is will this keep happening or a the muscles in my legs just getting use to running?",

(which is perfect for me i feel right now, i get really tired in my back and my legs after that). However, except the three last days i've been running around 800-1200m. That didnt make my back and my legs to hurt. I should mention that it took me 22 minutes to run 3.6km in my \"fastest\" speed i'd say. As well I should mention, I have not drank any sort of soda since the 17th of april, also I try to eat healthy. Am I doing this correctly? What can I do better? When can I try to see some changes to my body? By that I mean my \"breasts\" and my stomach. (I have not started to see any changes, yet.) I'm really thankful for any answers!",
            "Suggestions for how to prevent my shins and insides of my feet from hurting while running on a treadmill? I wear pretty decent Nike trainers while running, at least I feel like they are good shoes. Should I maybe get some running inserts?",
            "running a lot is what helped me. And biking pretty often. I ran every morning a mile and a half.",
            "How is cycling for cardio? I hate running for distance, never mind I can't run distance worth running for exercise. Would cycling help me get to being able to run for longer distance?",
            "Well, I am not in great shape and have asthma, a mild case, and I can sprint but I can't really run for distance. I also just hate running outside of sports it gets boring for me, for what ever reason cycling doesn't\n",
            "That was my EXACT situation as of two years ago. The second I hit 200 I knew I needed to change. I literally went out the same day and bought running shoes and started running. It doesn't matter how far/fast/well you run, the most important thing to do it actually DOING it. After that I bought a basic pull up bar from Walmart and started doing that after I went running. Also, and I can't stress this enough, stay as far away from sodas and extremely salty foods. Every time you think about it drink water. Tons of water. It will actually cause you to lose a good bit of weight as your body purges the \"water weight\" held on by salts. (I'm sure I'm getting terminologies wrong, I'm self taught-sorry). I guarantee that just by watching what you eat and getting rid of salt/sodas you will lose 5 or more pounds within a couple weeks. Couple that with running and in a month or so and you will really start to see results. Good luck! (I went from 200 to 175 in about 5 months, but with a good bit of work)",
            "From personal experience, I found results in stepping my workout up. This is all my own experience so try and take it as you will and apply it to you're own standards. When I was overweight I started running 1 mile everyday, then after a week I bumped it up to 1.5 miles and on and on. Now I'm at a constant steady 3.5 miles everyday and it's easy for me now. I know this isn't a ton of help but it's a starting point for cardio. ",
            "You have made the first step in recognizing the issue. I didn't like seeing a big fat bastard in the mirror either. I started running 2 years ago. At first it was run a quarter mile, walk home. Then half, now my short quick runs are 5Ks. On the weekends I run 10+ miles a day. I have lost 70 pounds (6 foot 225) and I feel great. Just remember; baby steps. My buddy is 41 and is your size he has already had a heart attack. Eating well and getting at least 45 min of cardio a day will get you there. As you know, there is mo magic pill other than \"get off your ass and get moving\". As added motivation I picked a race 6 months out and signex up for it. Good luck. ",

            "Running until you see black spots is not normal, so I wouldn’t push it and keep going. That’s dangerous. My first thought is that you’re not breathing correctly when you run. Who knew you have to actually focus on your breathing pattern, as if you don’t have to already focus on running and not falling. I was the same way as you. I could not run to save my life. I’d be gasping for air .3 miles in. But once I really started focusing on my breathing, it got a lot better. I guess I would hold my breath and/or take small breaths instead of full ones. \n\nBuilding your endurance can be tough. Start slow. Work on your breathing. Never push it to the point of pain or signs of weakness. ",
            "There are some apps you can get, that train you to run. Try something like 5k runner, it breaks it down into intervals of walking and running, and builds it up over the course of about 6/8 weeks, this really helped me focus on other things to distract myself (i find i can forget I'm running now, and therefore go further/faster than i did before). Breathing is definitely something you should concentrate on. Breath in for 4 steps, and out for five, keep your head high, to keep your airways open, focusing on a spot far away, like the top of a house, to make sure your chin doesn't slip back down :) hope this helps!",
            "In terms of running, you just have to build up your stamina, there is no “quick fix”. I started running when I was 123kg, and that took some real effort. Be lucky if I last half an hour running at a steady speed of 6km/h. Now I’m down to 85kg, and can run well over an hour at a rough speed of 9.5km/h.\n\nYou just need to start slow, and with each run you will feel better. You can then start stepping up your pace. I would advise running a few times a week, and with each week increase your speed and time a little.\n\nPersonally, I love cardio and hate the weights. And I spend most of my time on the treadmill. This really helped me shed the pounds. But as I’m sure others will say, your diet will play a big role in weightless. I didn’t go “totally healthy” with my diet, as I still allowed myself to indulge from time to time - you just have to do it in moderation!",

Hadn't run since my 20s, so this time i took a 'couch to 5k' course with a running shop, and learned IMMEDIATELY  that Ive been doing it wrong my whole running life.\n\nThey (and I) analysed my form on a treadmill w a camera and compared the footage side by side with video of proper form, and the difference was ASTOUNDING.\n\nFirst I was POUNDING the treadmill with my heels every step of the way, instead of landing with the mid or forefoot like I do now.  Second, I invested in good running shoes based on my gait and shoe wear pattern (i pronate but not excessively).\n\nThe difference has been night and day.  Where I used to have to ice down my knees and pop Aleve like candy after EVERY run, i rarely do now.\n\nMaybe not be directly relevant to your elliptical workouts, but maybe the treadmill work is affecting you more than you realize.\n\nSo, young Reddit friend if any of this sound painfully familiar, maybe go to a running shop that does free gait analysis...a good shop will work wih you and make appropriate recommendations on footwear that fits your budget.\n\nGood luck!\n\n",

During the trimming period, do a lot of high repetition, body weight workouts (lunges, single leg squats, wall sits, dips, push-ups, crunches, super mans, etc.) Once you have reached a good level of fitness, take your weights and do all of the same body weight workouts.

Instead of going 2 hours after eating I went 4.5 hours after lunch. I did my regular workout that I normally do on Thursday. I started feeling lightheaded again. Didn't think much of it and pushed through. When I was done with my hour long workout session the intensity started increasing. After about 20 Minutes it became even worse. My arms and legs started shaking and numbing sensation. I started getting cotton mouth really bad and having troubled vision as well a tingling sensation throughout my arms and legs. I also started becoming nautious. \n\nToday I wake up feeling better just really weak. This was a terrifying experience that I have never had before.

            "I've had femoral nerve problems for a while. They aren't specific to working out my legs, but I will let you know what I have learned from trying to deal with it. Keep in mind this is my experience only, but I think it could help.\n\n The nerve that it sounds like runs around the top of the thigh and the sheath that protects it runs into the hip. If that sheath is damaged in some way, you get that tingle, sometimes pain, sometimes just flat out numbness. The how and why it gets damaged depends on the person, I've been told, but your symptoms sound close to mine enough that it may be what I have, just being pinched in the hip. \n\nFor example, if I cross my legs, my thigh goes to sleep almost instantly. At first it bothered me, but I've gotten used to it. Now think about working legs...lot of bending at the hip, etc. It's possible that you're pinching the sheath and that's what's causing it. \n\nSo, how can you be sure. The way I was tested was they ran an electric current into my hip and measured the response. Two things: it hurts like a motherfucker and second, seriously, it fucking HURTS. And at the end of it, I was given a choice of them opening up my hip and leg and repairing (maybe) the sheath, or deal with it. Since you didn't say anything about loss of power or movement, I'll assume it's like mine and there isn't any. That was the deciding factor for me; it wasn't really affecting me that much (I was used to it by that point), so I've let it be. I have read that serious cases can limit movement, so if that's the case, get to the doctor.\n\nAgain, all of this is just my experience, not medical advice, but I hope it helped. And honestly, the worst part is feeling like my phone is vibrating in my pocket, when it's on the counter. I wouldn't overly worry but if you get weakness or mobility issues, see your doctor and it's probably worth mentioning anyway.\n\nTL;DR: Your nerve sheath may be getting pinched; if you have limited strength or motion, see someone with MD after their name.",

            "*Idk if this have been asked before and I do apologise if it is a repeated question* \n\nI really need some help with gaining mass. I have been working out for about a year now and I don't use protein. I'm 1.65m tall and weigh about 60 kgs. I currently workout about 3-4 days a week.\nThe problem that I'm facing is that I'm able to increase the reps or weights that I'm lifting. However, I don't seem to be growing any muscle mass, or rather I look just as small as I was before. I have peers that lift about the same weight as me and are of a similar height and weight range but look much bigger with chiselled chest and shredded biceps.\n\nMany have adviced me to eat more but I have a weak stomach and can't really eat as much as others do. I've resorted to increasing the frequency of my meals and eating about 4 eggs a day to increase my protein intake but it does not seem to be working as well. I don't micromanage my calories for now!\n\nDoes anybody have any advice with regard to this? Is eating more really the only way to get bigger? Would drinking protein help to get bigger or does it only help with recovery?\n\nThank you to all in advance!",

Freshman year of college was a pretty crazy time for me and I let partying and school make fitness get in the back seat for about a year. As a result, I gained some beer weight and have gotten significantly out of shape.\n\nNaturally, when I first recently started going down the weight room I would make an excuse to cut my workout short because I would be so exhausted.

Make sure you're eating right, cut out sodas, as many foods that have added sugar, try to basically eat a diet that's as raw as possible. I'm not saying eat raw meat, but raw vegetables, steamed vegetables, fruit, light, minimally processed food, unprocessed, get your meat from a local farmer, try to stay away from all the additives and preservatives.

Artificial sweeteners are finiky and are starting to come out as causing lots of side effects (myself and a lot others have restless leg whenever I have it.... which blows). So I stopped all my artificial sweeteners except the small amount that's in my protein by default but it's stevia based. I can't stand stevia sweeteners but it's the best choice out there when picking a sweetener. Every morning I use flavored creamer in my coffee...it's the one thing I don't substitute and that's the best time to have your most sugar, then you have the rest of the day to burn it off. As to the amount....it's all about what kind of food you're eating instead of how much sugar. As long as you're putting in complex sugars and carbs you can afford to have a bit more...as they are naturally in the foods and not part of a processed group (like fruits). However....as a rule of thumb you want to keep the majority of your carbs and sugars in the first half of your day and move to your starches and protein in the evening (oatmeal is an exception). \n\nI wish I could give you an exact number of sugars but to be honest it's about what eating plan you're following. I teach all my clients about the modified 3 hour diet. for MOST people that are cutting I recommend eating 300 calories every 3 hours, 5 times a day. The amazing thing about this plan is it's not restricting of any food group in it's entirety (ofc we want only healthy fats and even then in moderation along with sugar). And once you've been on this eating plan for a week your body will tell you what it needs...it's truly amazing. After a workout I need carbs....so every day I make a banana chocolate oatmeal pancake with natural peanut butter...others are good with their shakes or even a huge chicken breast.

It's the processed sugar and processed carbs you gotta watch out for.\n\nWhat I've done to help hundreds to shred weight and keep it off is the 300 calorie way of eating. Eat 300 calories, every 3 hours 5 times a day (for starters). For bread, I'd highly recommend Dave's Killer bread. Nuts N More makes some amazing tasting peanut butter spreads (or just make sure you're buying natural PB). PB2 powder is great for shakes too!  Get on a good protein. Protein isn't just for beefy dudes lifting, the aminos and broken down enzymes that are in good protein shakes now will help out a ton when eating healthy.\n\nTurkey, tuna, salmon, chicken, etc when it comes to meats. Also, don't confuse carbs with starches. For instance, when I say keep the majority of your carbs in the first half of your day that doesn't mean you can't have some healthy starches with your protein for dinner (sweet potatoes, squash, etc). Also, plan plan plan ahead. I'd recommend a modified version of No Bake Energy Balls if you Google it. If you're on the go or at work and need that 3 hour snack and don't have the time, make these balls excuse yourself to the bathroom and woof one down. They're amazing (just one a day tho).

If you stop what you started you wont get better results. Trust me, hahaha\n\n14- You are very young. Trust yourself with patient. Be confident.\n\n15- Add some metabolic food/drink. Like Green/Hibiscus tea, peppers, coffee, cinnamon, cocoa powder, avocado...\n\n16- Look about what your body are telling you.\n\n17- Change the way you workout. Are doing too fast? Too slowly? Are you losing muscle tension when exercising? Do you workout with focus? Are you doing full range of motion?\n\n18- How much do you cheat your nutrition?\n\n19- Cut, if possible, any caloric drink. Fruit juice, milk, soda...Also, eat less diary if possible.\n\n20- Change fake/junk food for real food always.\n\n21- Don't drink anything when you are eating.\n\n22- You are tall. That means you have to eat more to see the results. If you can't do big meals, do more meals per day. And some times do little fasting to improve your insulin sensitivity.\n\n23- Eat more dense foods. Like nuts. They have good fats, high caloric and help with male hormones.\n\n24- Avoid drugs (including alcohol)\n\n25- Do high intensity workout. Rest less between the sets and exercises.\n\n26- Don't pass more than 1 hour and 20 minutes working out.\n\n27- Some people says to avoid oxidants close to the training. Like Vitamins C, E, Omega 3 and Selenium. I guess is good to try.\n\n== EDITED ==",

            "You need time to digest before go to the gym. Avoid fats (at this moment) and slowly digest foods.  \nThe most important is carb to recover glycogen.  If I've less than 1 hour I drink a shake. \n\nAfter 1 hour and half of heavy workout you probably will get cortisol. So eating or drinking something is nice to break it.\n\nAgain, it don't need to be a \"super fast\" carb or protein. But for me I avoid the very slowly food at this time too.\n\nIn other moments I go to what I need and didn't eat before.\n\nI guess BCAA normally help with glycogen and is fast digest. With the right carb you will cut off this \"tired\" effect.\n\nStay the entire day with a good meal plan. Real food. The right macros and micros for your goals and results will come.  \n",

First, you gotta find the motivation to workout and to better yourself. I was the same way, i had to find a good motivator for me to workout and now I love it.\n\nAlso, I know a lot of people won’t agree with me but you should try to fit in about an hour of lifting 4-6 times a week depending on how hard you want to go and how your training plays out. 30 minutes twice a week isn’t going to give you the results you’re looking for. You won’t see results of really any REAL workout plan for at least 6 weeks, so before you start working out you need to know you won’t wake up next week 20 pounds heavier with a six pack.

Well, I'm okay with my looks right now. My body looks pretty average, and not so bad. But of course, it can be better. And that's it, really.

            "Hi there, good on you for wanting to improve yourself, it's never too late:). What sort of equipment do you have at home? Depending on your goals, as to whether you're looking to gain muscle, lose fat etc, it would be best for you to know what your macronutrient &amp; caloric intake should look like. You can type your age, weight, height, activity level etc into this calculator below and it will work it out for you. It will give an approximate indication of how much protein, carbohydrates and fats you need to be consuming. You should aim to eat 1g of protein per 1lbs of your bodyweight and drink plenty of water:). \n\nhttps://www.katyhearnfit.com/macro-calculator\n\nMyFitnessPal is an awesome app by the way, you can enter all of your macros goals and keep track of what you are eating throughout the day.\n\nSo if you are looking to gain muscle or lose fat, either way, the best and more effective way to do it is by lifting heavy weights, by squatting, deadlifting, bench press etc...or at least eventually. \nBut if you are looking to workout at home, you could start with squatting with dumbells, also biceps curls, push ups, any other bodyweight exercises, like dips, burpees for cardio etc and get your form on point for all exercises. Then progress to lifting weights at the gym with pretty much the same exercises, as you will really make significantly more progress through lifting heavy weights. \n\nI don't use home workout sites/apps, so I couldn't recommend one in particular but there are plenty apps that you can download on googleplay. They'll get you started in the right direction and usually provide workouts for each muscle group.\n\nI hope that makes sense and helps you in some way, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions. Good luck:)♡.\n",

            "Hey, I'm a 15 year old soccer player, on summer vacation, and I really want to work out and get stronger. The main reason is, because I was on JV2 for my high school soccer team, and at the end of the school interviews, the head coach talked to me, and said I was an excellent player, I'm just not strong enough. I'm about 5'7\" and around 125 pounds. I know I'm not that strong, so I figured it can't hurt to work out anyway. I'm in decent shape, endurance wise, but not strength wise. Well, let me rephrase that, my upper body isn't strong, but my lower body is, but I'm sure I could use some lower body workout as well. I know I need to work out, but I can never seem to make myself do it. My main problem is my computer, I'm constantly on my computer, gaming. The entire time, I know I should be working out, but I never am. I need to get motivated, or something to workout. If you guys have any tips on that, that'd be great, but to the main point of this post. I think if I just had a daily plan to go by, I would be a lot better off. I prefer not to use a gym, as I'm short on money at the moment. I have no equipment at my house, other than an elliptical, but like I said, I have decent endurance, so that's not really helpful. If you guys had some tips as to how to get motivated/willing to workout, that would be appreciated. My main request is workout routines, that are available at home, with no equipment. This request is probably way out there, but I might as well try. Thanks in advance for your help and time.",
            "This post became longer than I intended to. You can skip the back story portion of this to give quick feedback on my programming questions. Sorry if my writing is all over the place, I wasn't the best in grammar and literature haha. \n\n\n\n\n-backstory-\n2 years ago I decided to finally make the plunge in the fitness world. I was a little guy, 5'3 135lbs, and with no real fitness history I was really week. I went full on developing strength. I wasn't the most consistent but I was seeing results slowly but surely. Benching was really feeling smooth and I felt like I had a good grasp of my form, even though form always needs to be worked on. Then there's squats and deadlifts. I was ignorant and stubborn when it came to these lifts. Everybody at the gym was lifting these really heavy lifts and to be honest, I was quite intimidated. So I tried to work up quickly in these and not listen to by body. I was pounding my body with not the greatest form. My lower back started to feel tight and I got really scared so I just stopped going to gym altogether, I was really down on myself.\n\nI think my personal best on the lifts is 155 bench, 220 deadlift, and 190 squat.\n\n-present time-\n\nSo now 2 years later I am ready to put my fears behind and really give it my all while taking care of my body.\nI like how this split has days dedicated to taking care of my body and conditioning.\n\nSmall guy 2 years ago has now turned into very slightly pudgy 5'3 155lb. \n\nSo my question for advice would be like this.\nI want to work up my basic strength to get back into the big compound lifts while trying to perfect my form in all lifts.\nCurrently my push up strengh is lacking and pull up strengh is non-existent. My legs, core, and etc will also need a lot of love.\n\n-Programming my workout-\n\nI want to focus on keeping my body healthy and not just big and strong. I did 5/3/1 for a little bit before and I really enjoyed plugging in my numbers on some sites and it does the math for me and it's nice progression I can easily track.\n\nJim Wendler's Beyond 5/3/1 has a program split that's like this.\nMonday - Upper body\nTuesday - Flexibility/Moblility\nWednesday - Conditioning\nThursday - Lower body\nFriday - Flexibility/Mobility\nSaturday - Conditioning\n\nI need help programming assistance workouts targeting all my important body parts in the lower body/upper body split while ideas for my condition and flexibility/mobility workouts.\n\nSo my first main goals would go like this.\n1. Flexibility/mobility - for getting my body back on track to being healthy and ready for anything I'll throw at it.\n2. Conditioning* - being 155-160lb isn't that heavy but for a short guy like me, it can be. So I would like to get that weight down.\n3. Strength and form - I want to build basic strenght while working on my form for the big 3 lifts\n\n*I need to get into a good diet and nutrition schedule also. Was gonna ask about it in a different post but if you guys really want, you can give advice on that too.\n\nThank you sooooo much if you just even gave this post a read even if you don't give feedback. It means a lot to me and what a great time to get back into it with a great outlet like Reddit.\n",

First of all, start very slowly. Look to what your body tell you every day. Remove bad food. Sleep a lot. Drink a lot of water, green tea, hibiscus tea, caffeine, vitamins... Fasting 2 or 3 time a week can help a lot when you know how to do it in the right way.\n\nSome people go to a specific diet plan. I think it's ok, but I didn't. I put the carbs 90% in my post workout. I ate a lot of protein and good fat. But not like a Keto diet or a true low carb with no carb.\n\nIf you are really serius remove sugar, fried food and industrial ones.\nLook for the food with low calories density.\n\nAbout cardio, I didn't anything.

It's a gradual thing, built on months of repetition and slightly increasing weight loads over time, and before you know it, you'll see gains.\n-If you're trying to do a complicated routine, don't start with something basic, like 4 core lifts, and add auxiliary lifts from there.\n-I've grew up learning that it's all about intensity. If you go through your workout with leisure then you won't make the big gains. Always workout with intensity and with a purpose.\nThose are my tips for you today, I'm by no means an expert, But I learned a good bit about working out from my football coaches in high school. So if you want to chat, feel free to message me.",

            "Only been regularly working out for a few months myself so I'm no pro, but I find three things have been most important to my progress so far.\n\n• Find a few friends who workout and learn from them. Everyone was a beginner at one point and they can teach you a lot. Also it's great for motivation both ways.\n• Watch a lot of YouTube videos to learn correct form and to find new exercises. My favorite channel is Athlean X because he explains each muscle group as well as how to strengthen them.\n• Improve your diet. It doesn't have to be a major change all at once. Even little things like cutting out soda and fast food are a good way to start.",

            "If I were you I would invest in some dumbells for at home workouts, try something that is adjustable up to 15 kg. Furthermore, try to do bodyweight exercises at home and try different exercises from time to time. I did this exact thing, seeing my arms gaining everytime I used the dumbells provided huge motivation for me and instead of having some chicken arms, I actually have a full toned arm! I also gained about 10 kg in a few months, without actually becoming fat. Of course this might not be the case for you but seeing your story (which is exactly the same as my story) this might work well for you too! Also try to monitor how much kcal you consume per day, if you want to gain with your (probably) fast metabolism you'll have to eat somewhere near 2800-3000 kcal per day (but don't start eating unhealthy because you need the calories!). I wish you all the best!",

I find that as long as you really try that its good either way as long as your just right there.. Thank you by the way! Im the one in the video :D",

            "HIIT (high-intensity interval training) might be one of those exercise fads with staying power. Why? Because with a workout that can span anywhere from five to 15 minutes, the results are the same, if not better, than a traditional one-hour workout.\n\nHigh-intensity training has many benefits that go beyond the time you save doing the exercises. Not only will you burn fat more efficiently, but you'll also get a total body workout you can customize to your goals. Don’t have access to a gym or weights? Do HIIT. Need a quick warm-up session tailored to your chosen sport? Do HIIT. Want to combine cardio and strength training? HIIT may very well be your answer.\n\nHow to Do It\n\nA good HIIT program will include exercises that target multiple muscle groups at once to maximize your training. A routine could easily consist of a high intensity cardio workout like: high knees, sprints, or jump roping for a minute followed by another minute of an exercise like weighted split squats, Spider-Man push-ups, or triceps dips. The goal is to alternate the minute of high intensity with a minute of low-intensity workout that allows you to recover while concentrating on other muscle groups.\n\n- See more at: http://www.fitnessrepublic.com/fitness/exercises/why-hiit-is-such-a-mega-fat-burner.html",

            "Hello. I am 16 years old (male) and I am doing the physical section of my Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award for 18 months at the gym. I visit the gym once a week for around 90 minutes to 2 hours. I have discussed just about everything regarding my DofE programme with my instructor, and we have decided that I will be logging improvements in my stamina, muscular endurance &amp; muscular and core strength to see how I am doing over the short term. I am also participating in cycling on a weekly basis to exercise outside of the gym, usually for around 2-3 hours each time. I also walk my dog (labrador, to give an idea of how long he needs!) on a daily basis.\n\nHowever, I need to decide on my long term goal (what I hope to achieve by the end of my DofE programme). I have narrowed it down to running a certain distance (km) in a certain amount of time on a treadmill. What would be a good goal? I was thinking I could maybe manage 10km in 45 minutes if I'm spending 18 months exercising at the gym, cycling and walking weekly. Think this would be an okay goal to tell my instructor? Any suggestions, please let me know in the comments. Also, please feel free to ask any questions if you want to know something or I didn't explain something clearly enough.\n\nThanks.",
            "Hi there.\n\nI am going to have a lot of free time the next 6 - 7 weeks and I would like to use that time to get in a bit better shape. I've joined a gym and I got some decent jogging shoes. If anyone could help me piece together a training plan I would really appreciate that. \n\nI am 5'9'' (175cm), 170 lbs(77kg) and in my mid 30's. I have not been working out a lot, but I am not totally new to a gym either. For a relatively untrained person I am somewhat strong, but my endurance and conditioning is just shit. I have a couple medical issues that will slightly limit my workouts. \n\nMy biggest problem related to working out is eczema. Days where my eczema is bad I can't really do cardio as sweating is a real problem and I will also need to take breaks between sets to keep heartrate down. As I can't predict when my eczema flares up I need to have a somewhat flexible workout plan(On average I'd say about 2-3 days of the week I will be unable to break a sweat).\n\nMy other problem is with my hands causing me to have limited grip strength / endurance(If I do assisted pullups the grip is the limiting factor, not back / arm muscles). This is a much smaller problem than the eczema, but something I need to keep in mind.\n\nI currently smoke about 10 - 15 a day, but will cut down a bit during these 6 weeks, my diet is also really crap mainly consisting of pizza, chocolate and snacks. I will try my best to eat more vegetables and lean meat while doing this, if you have any suggestions on what food I need to be eating I'm all ears though.\n\nMy gym is open 24/7 and I will spend as much time as needed there.\n\nAny tips / tricks to maximize the results of my little \"workout binge\" would be appreciated. Will check in on this thread often if you need some additional information.",

I stopped working out as much when I was a senior, because I had some personal issues. I’ve started working out again in my home, with 15, 25 pound dumbbells.

I didn’t work them out before because I was stupid and only thought the chest mattered. My main question is if someone could give me a workout plan to get back into shape; so I can start training for mass.

            "Hey there, everyone.\n\nI recently started working out with a friend of mine. My height is 6' 1\", weight is 180 pounds. I'm not sure exactly what my weight goal is, but I know I want to significantly gain muscle mass. My upper body is very frail. We work out six days a week, but it's never the same focus on a body part every day.\n\nWhile working out, my friend told me to take a few protein supplements. I was just wondering what you all thought of the following products and/or what your experiences with them were:\n\nJack3d Micro - take one 30-45 minutes before working out. \n\nKre alkalyn Creatine - take 30-45 minutes before working out.\n\nUp Your Mass protein shake - take after working out. My biggest concern with this is that each protein shake I mix with water contains over 500 calories and has 46 grams of protein? I know protein is great for working out, but is that much protein from a protein shake healthy?\n\nI've been working out for two weeks now and already see major improvements. However, I just added the protein supplements to my routine as of today. \n\nWhat do you all think of these supplements? Also, is there anything you would advise a really motivated, but incredibly new, guy in working out? I've browsed through this discussion board quite a bit, but I may have missed something.\n\nThanks.",

I usually only eat an apple and a banana but still feel empty while working out. Any recommendations?",
            "I'm no expert, but I think it's mostly about what you eat *and then* exercise. Specifically, how many calories you eat. In order to gain muscle mass, you need to consume calories in surplus of what you expend. In other words, you'd be better off looking at diets/etc. I can't help with numbers (i.e. how many calories you need to consume) b/c, well, I only know what works for me. The FAQ explains this a little more specifically than I can. Also, you may want to edit your post so that others can help you out more:\n\n1.) How long have you been doing this routine? \"A while\" for some people is a month, and for others its a few years. This will make a difference. And more than once a week is probably recommended. 3X a week should suffice, but, again, I'm no expert. Concentrate on the diet first, though.\n\n2.) What exactly are you doing? Again, the FAQ goes into this some more, but the number of repetitions and sets affects the gains you will see (assuming your diet is in order). We have no idea how long you spend at the gym? 15 min.? 30 min.? Sets/reps is better information than time, however.\n\n3.) There is something incongruous about your workout routine. While there's nothing wrong with working abs, when you say \"build a little more muscle,\" are you looking to reveal abs or bulk them? I'm assuming you want definition, which will require a loss of fat, which will require a diet with a caloric deficit, which will counteract any gains you want to see in your arms/chest. Again, I don't really know. This is only what I understand. Basically, I think you'll have to decide if you want to bulk or cut. I'm assuming bulk (and then you can cut slowly to reveal abs). Anyway, the other thing about your workout is your targets: shoulders and back are missing (I'm guessing you'd like to forget about legs). I'd suggest a more rounded-out workout routine.\n\n4.) This is the most important thing: height and weight. This is necessary information for the number-crunching. And it'll give us a better idea of what you're working with.\n\nAnyway, I've never been on your side of the spectrum. I'm trying to lose weight while converting as much fat to muscle as I can. So, please, if anyone here thinks I've misled you or left something out, feel free to correct me.\n\nEdit: Shit, I forgot that the FAQ I'm referring to is actually in /r/fitness. Read it, for sure. There's all sorts of helpful information in there, free calorie counters (which I'd recommend--I use myfitnesspal.com), etc. Many will say eat a lot--and a lot of protein--if you want to bulk, which is true, but you need to count calories to maximize your gains. For example, you may think you are eating a lot when in reality you are only eating enough (with exercise) to maintain your current weight. Gains will be hard to come by this way. I believe--don't hold me to this, though--that if you fill out a profile on myfitnesspal.com, you can select what weight you want to lose/gain each week (I'm unsure about the gain thing. I would hope that it's an option).",

            "\"Toned\" is a very subjective term. Try to be more objective with your goals.  Most people who say toned are referring to that beach body style physique (well developed arms, visible abs, etc) so if that's the case then most likely no.  I suppose you could put on a couple pounds of muscle but not enough to change your physique radically.  When you're first starting out like you are the best way to make progress is to take advantage of your newbie gains.  Get a gym membership and start with something like a Starting Strength program.  Heavy compound lifts with little to no cardio.  Realistically you should be able to put on about 20 pounds of muscle in your first year with good nutrition and dedicated lifting.",
            "I'm just saying that muscle is denser than fat. You can gain muscle and lose fat in the process, but not lose any weight.\n\nThat being said finding the right balance (protein/carb/fats and oils) is up to you. You may want to start out and gain as much muscle as you can to kick up your metabolism. This will make losing fat later on a lot easier.\n\nIf you want to go the route of losing fat while gaining some muscle tone, you may want to try something like a MetCon or full body workout to attack both fronts. Here's a decent article on it - http://www.mensfitness.com/training/cardio/metcon-training-full-body-workout.\n\nIt just depends on what your precise goals are and how quickly you want to see results. Personally I use both of the above to maintain musculature with light and heavy weightlifting days and challenge my body enough to lose some stubborn fat via the MetCon workouts.",

I suppose that's not entirely unusual to have worse DOMS two days later than you had the very next day after a workout. \n\nSide note: I used to take a cold bath immediately after a workout and I was 100% DOMS free but I recently read that you should wait at least an hour to give inflammation a chance to build up otherwise the cold inhibits muscle growth. Since then I wait at least an hour to take a cold bath and now I have some DOMS, but not too bad, and I started getting a little bigger immediately.",

Then its all about effort.  To me these hiit workouts, everyone should be working to THEIR maximum effort. Whether theyre an athlete or whether you are just starting out, it should always be hard. \n\nSo, give it all you have, if you need to rest for 10 / 20 / 30 seconds then rest... keep the video going (sorry, I cant see what you are doing exactly, the link isn't working for me), and then rejoin when you have caught your breath (again, stay hydrated). It will be hard, but it will get easier... that's when you kick on to something harder.\n\nYou should measure success in achieving more and by using a tape measure on your waist (or whatever you are looking to change). Scales can often \"lie\" if you are putting weight on, it could be due to muscle increases. So I tend not to use them often.\n\nUnless i'm bulking"

Training with bells combines work for your strength growing, development of endurance and flexibility. The likelihood of injuries is also very low, due to the fact that movements are mainly natural. Since the basic exercises are complex (more than the 1 joint involved) - you can get a huge stimulus to the growth of muscle mass at the hormonal level. I recommend that you Steve Cotter`s materials.

Try to make a simple and specific goal, like squeeze 100kg or get 80 kilos of total body weight etc. You must learn to enjoy the training process. Believe me that is really important!\n\nAs for the training program itself, specifically for fast muscle gain and strength building, I can advise complex movements. These include squats, dead lifts, pull-ups, jerks, snatches, different kinds of presses and pulls. \n\nStart with something simple and gradually increase the number of approaches and exercises in each following workout. \n\nI can talk a lot about diet and healthy eating, but it will be meaningless at this stage and it will only complicate everything. Think simple in this direction. Get more natural proteins and less sugars. Whole-grain cereals are great, processed flakes - really bad. And water. Do not forget about it! Force yourself to drink clean water. Start with 2 liters per day.\n\nGood luck!",

I would recommend you to conduct your strength training in an intensive style. Since you can not work with heavy weight, your training will also be aimed at strengthening the cardiovascular system in the first place. In this case, focus on nutrition.

These exercises use your own body weight, so you are less likely to get injured. I recommend pairing these exercises with hill sprints. It is a high pace workout and enables you to continue your running training uninterrupted. My only other advice is to strengthen your lower body as well. Perhaps walking lunges back up with hill. ",

Concentrate on the selection of quality products. An excellent choice of complex carbohydrates will be: oatmeal, buckwheat, brown rice, whole wheat and rye flour bread. Protein products are also usually rich in fats. This is a natural combination of microelements which you should not be afraid of. The only recommendation is not to combine high-fat protein products and large portions of carbohydrates. You must choose a diet that you can really adhere to. \n\nDrink plenty of water. Drink more than you want! \n\nAdd some strengths workout in the morning. These can be push-ups, squats, pull-ups etc. Do some training activity each day. You need to make some progression on each movement. This is really important to change your body. And keep walking! Take it as a test and try to get satisfaction and pleasure from the work done.

As you see yourself everyday it will be difficult to see growth in the mirror. Having a goal like your first pull up or squat 200lbs is a great way to see growth and not focus on aesthetics, which will eventually change as your progress with your training.  ",

Tighten up your ABS and keep travelling side to side. You are activating those outer thighs and glutes. Clik: https://imgur.com/gallery/XxjTQQN\n\n2. Single-Leg Deadlift：Push all of your weight into your left heel. Reach right leg back in in back and just a quick reach with that right leg. Bend the left leg for the whole time. All of your weight is in your left heel. And then lift right leg up and down. Click: https://imgur.com/gallery/jj00gon\n\n3. Sumo Squats：Take a wide stance and do some sumo squats. Turn out your toes for 45 degrees. Push your butt back, squat down and squeeze glutes as you lift. Bring it up and down. Don’t completely straighten legs because you only lift about 3/4 of the way up. Click: https://imgur.com/gallery/Ou9eoP5\n\n4. Standing Triceps Extension：Bring a band around your wrists and do a squat curl to press. Separate your arms as much as you can. Come up your bicep curl, squat your low curl and press it down. Focus on holding arms apart the whole time. You are firing up multiple muscles. Click: https://imgur.com/gallery/8EJFUcE\n\n5. Sumo Walks Backwards：Stand on the inside of the band and set the band at your feet. Stand with your feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Squat down and push your butt back. Stay low and take six steps back. Turn around to go back the other way. Click: https://imgur.com/gallery/vQviLDE\n\n6. Lunge：Hold the band in right hand. Place the band underneath left foot so it’s across your body. Step your right foot back. Stay into a lunge bending both knees 90 degrees. Push off right foot and kick the heel up. Make sure you are dropping as low as you can in the lunge. Click: https://imgur.com/gallery/jFqDpoi\n\n7. Sumo Deadlift：Pulses Bring a band underneath feet. Separate feet as wide as you can. Keep a flat back but push your butt back. Reach for one end of that the end from band. Lift the band up and down. Click: https://imgur.com/gallery/01BjDDE\n\n8. Single Deadlift：Reach left leg forward and bring a band underneath left foot. Make sure the band is secure so it doesn’t snap back and hit you in the face. Straight up shoulder to the wrist. Pull right elbow up and then release arm down. Doing a low to high wide row. Keep the core tight you want to pull with the elbow. Click: https://imgur.com/gallery/rSgPgST\n\n9. Side-to-side Push-ups：Bring a band around wrists. Find a plank position and feel free to find this plank from your toes or from your knees. Step your hand over to the left, do a push-up and then bring that hand back. Click: https://imgur.com/gallery/q2Joeeb\n\n10. Bicycle Legs： Lie on the floor and wrap the band around your feet. Never let knees pass your hips. Extend left leg straight and push heel forward. Switch your two legs for cycling. It’s a small movement for feeling your quads a little bit.

            "When I was in high school we had four core lifts. Bench, squat, power clean, and power ply (leg press essentially). You needed a percentage increase to get a good grade. Anyway, that's basically three leg lifts, even if power clean is full body. So I'd do cleans and bench one day (+other upper body stuff like BI's and back or whatever) then the next day id do squats and press. Again don't overdo it right away. "

It is comprised of two movements: the clean, where the bar is pulled from the floor and caught in the front rack position in three pulls or phases, followed by the jerk overhead. The clean and jerk hits every muscle from head to toe and can be the centerpiece of a lifting program. It is also popular in CrossFit and athletic training programs. It is usually performed in low rep ranges, focusing on power and movement quality.",

If you working out regularly you just need to gradually reduce the amount of carbohydrates in your diet. It is also worth not forgetting about a sufficient amount of clean water, at least 2 liters every day. You can choose protein foods to your liking and mix it with green vegetables. Remember that the diet should bring you lightness and not irritation. Therefore, start gradually and plan your diet for a long period and everything will necessarily turn out. Good luck!",
            "You’re not at a bad weight for your height.  Eat clean, and get on a program.  Stick to the program and stick to the clean diet.  Look at starting strength or strong lifts.  I’m a fan of starting strength.  Good luck on your journey!\n\n",

            "Eat eat eat eat eat. Eating more (clean food) is the vast majority of putting on muscle, and no you do not need a base of fat to build muscle, they’re independent of each other. If you workout without eating more than you’re used to, you’ll just get a little more lean without putting on mass. Here are the steps commonly used to start a good bulk, and have personally helped me put on good weight: \n\n1. Set a goal weight after a set amount of time (I want to be 70kgs in 3 months)\n2. Look up macro intakes for that desired weight. Macros include tracking your calories, proteins, fats, and carbs. \n3. Research foods and meals that help hit your macros \n4. Eat those foods and hit your macros daily\n5. Don’t forget to stick with your workout plan too! Eating excess food without working out is where you gain bad weight. \n\nStick with a basic 5x5 strength building plan (there’s tons online). Focus on getting stronger, not bigger. Strength training is the first step of building, in addition to dieting. \n\nI will warn you though, hitting excess macros (force feeding) is harder than limiting your diet when you first start. \n\nResearch supplements online as well. Mass gainers are shakes that are packed with the macro essentials and help you hit your daily macro goals. ",
            "Not a personal trainer, but I have a decent amount of knowledge on this kinda stuff. I would say ideally, you wouldn’t go into a workout being full or on an empty stomach. You don’t necessarily need to have a preworkout meal, but if you do I would recommend a small, slightly more carb heavy meal about 45 minutes before to fuel your workout. In terms of postworkout meals, I would always try and have a protein heavy meal (with some carbs as well) within an hour or so of working out, to achieve optimal recovery and muscle growth. The amount you eat and how hard you train will all depend on your diet of course. In your case of wanting to cut down, you want to keep your training intensity and volume on the Lower end, to preserve as much muscle mass as possible while you’re dropping those pounds of fat. Either way, you shouldn’t need to sweat TOO much about when you’re eating. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you have one bad meal or miss your post workout eating window every now and again. As long as you’re eating clean and focusing on your nutrition, you should be golden.\n\nGood luck friend! ",
            "most of your training should be heavy compound movements that engage many muscle groups at once (bench press, squat,deadlift, power clean, snatch, etc.), while isolation movements are important, compound movements should be the primary movements in your workout. And the most important thing to remember is to give it your all, if you know you can do 1 more rep but choose not to, you aren't training hard enough, each set should go until failure."

Overtraining will occur if you do, and it will inhibit your progress and can make you sick.  \nAs your body gets used to training you will feel less soreness.

You would benefit from including weights and working out individual muscles  (I.e. separate exercises for separate muscles; biceps curl for bicep, tri extension, military press for shoulders, bench press for pecs, forearm wrist curls, lat. pull downs). If you're noticing gains in your upper body without any in your forearms, I don't think you're new additions will combat that. You should isolate them.

I was wondering if anyone that could good me a good workout routine or workout program that could help me gain more mass and muscle. I feel that I'm too skinny and need too be around 160-165. I don't want to really be massive, more lean than mass. Any tips are appreciated. And if you have any questions about my physique or experience just ask. Thanks!",
            "What the topic says, goal is to build tone first and then mass. Any help appreciated!",

But I would say cardio and core are my primary focuses with strength being the third focus. \n\nI’ll be working out for an hour Monday through Friday. Any tips on what my days should look like? \n\nThanks for any advice ",
            "I am a (f)21 yo, 125lbs collage student. I’m not really trying to lose weight, rather I’m trying to tone up and get more definition. \nI’ve been doing some really great at home routines right after I wake up, as I have work and class all day. \nI typically do it on an empty stomach and eat breakfast afterwards. However, I’m unsure if this is conducive for muscle gain and toning. \nSince I’m on a time crunch and only have about two hours in the morning, I’m looking for a pre workout snack that’ll help me in toning and gaining muscle while also easy/quick to digest so I can start my routine. \nWhat are some recommendations? Are energy bars or protein shakes any good for my situation? I don’t want to continue to workout on an empty stomach if it won’t benefit me. \nAny tips are much appreciated. Thanks! ",
            "Hi guys,\n\n2 weeks ago I switched my workouts from calisthenics to having extra weight on me while working out. \nI just wanted to share this. If somebody of you guys wants to gain muscle size with this kind of workout. I can only encourage you!\n\nAfter only 2 weeks I feel and look buffer than before. \nI will keep you updated in the next weeks 👍🏽",

            "I use serious mass by optimum nutrition. It's packed full of calories and has good protein content...it'll help put mass on EVERYWHERE if its hard for you to add muscle",
            "You want to eat lots of protein.  Cut out sugars. And carbs. You can also go to a local GNC store and buy preworkout pills and creatine they help put glucose and sugar back into your muscles faster for quick recovery.  You will need to eat fats but lots of protein. Muscle milk will help to. You just gotta keep gaining on your weight lifting too!",
            "None yet, been trying to gain naturally but not above starting to take it",
            "Cardio doesn't make you gain muscle mass as much as a dedicated weight treining would. \n\nTry squatting 30kg in five sets of five instead, gradually increasing WEIGHT every time you do the workout, which ideally would be once every three-four days, to let the muscles regenerate.\n\nYou're overtraining right now.",
            "Might be as little as two weeks for you to feel better about working out. Have to stick with it though. Don't skip days. Could also take a month or two. Really hard to say. \n\nResults? Depends on what you're basing it off of. Just the scale? You'll most likely gain weight first (muscle) then the muscle eats your fat while you're just chillin. So that can take awhile. But notice other things too, like your energy level, alertness &amp; focus, overall happiness, how your poops are different, libido..... I'd also suggest that before every meal be grateful for whatever nourishment it's going to give you. Just being appreciative can put you in the right headspace for progress. On that note motivation isn't reliable. Persistence is. So even when you feel like shit, go and do something. Tangent. \n\nI don't use whey protein because it made me feel gross and heavy. Also because dairy is inflammatory. So I use vegan protein powders. #peaproteins. Haha. So I can't help you with that point. \n\nGood luck! You can do it. ",
            "The thing is, you're not listening to anyone, which is kinda rude.\n\nYou don't have abs. You are skinny. You can lose fat which will make you look unhealthy but you will probably get down to whatever muscle you have, and some rib definition. If that's what girls go for nowadays then go for it. Cardio yourself to exhaustion.\n\nIf you want to put on muscle, you'll be lucky to pack on a pound - 2 pound in a month. And you can't just pack on muscle into your abs without adding it anywhere else. The body likes to grow together.\n\nSo the advice is, to make the best start you can with muscle gains, eating plenty, lifting, ab work etc. In 5 weeks you won't be mr big but you will look better. Keep doing it until next summer and you'll be amazed.\n\nThere is no quick fix. End of. Take the advice or leave it.",

            "I think that you should not train your arms so often. Better pay more attention to large muscle groups. Arms also work well in complex movements, such as jerk and snatch. If I were in your place, I would include these exercises in your workouts.",
            "In general, doing arms 3 times a week is good. Everyone's different though. Another trick (If you see no difference) is working the muscle group everyday for a month. If you have some time, look up nucleus overloading, or squatting everyday. You'll find a lot more information there.",
            "Chicken, brown rice, leafy vegetables, egg whites, whey protein powder, bacon, salmon are all good things to eat for muscle development.",
            "I definitely recommend you to start lifting weight with a workout routine according to your goal (look into T Nation website or similar) This routine should include cardio (hiit seems to be a good option) to kill your fat and build some muscle (not easy to build muscle and lose fat if you’re beginner) But you wont reach your goal if you don’t eat properly. Keep your macros at right level (google it) and use some supplements such as protein shake and multivitamin. If you drink alcohol, leave it. 2 lt / day of water also.\nDiet + workout = results",
            "What do you mean by doing 100 benches? Are you bench pressing 100 times? If you are, I'm not I've ever heard of that before. What are you trying to accomplish by working out? Are you trying to lose weight or gain muscle mass or another goal? It's general practice to use a muscle split workout or at least a upper/lower split, working different muscle groups on different days of the week to allow your muscles to recover. If you're tied to this 100 benches thing, then maybe mix it up with 100 squats, curls, deadlifts, rows, different grip presses, etc",
            "Gotta decide what you wish to do first. Lose fat, gain muscle, or tone up. I've had just a little experience in losing fat and gaining muscle. For weight loss, I did cardio and did not eat junk food. Treadmill (jogging/sprints), and jumping are great to do. Muscle gain was just lifting dumbbells and making myself eat some meat from time to time.\n\nIn any case, all those hippies who recommend pills, supplements, etc are idiots and you do not need anything more than some dumbbells and an area for cardio ",
            "Oh, you’re trying to gain mass! Well I’d say making sure you eat more than you burn on any given day would be a start. Look at a weightlifting program to build muscle mass on top of that. ",
            "If you’re trying to gain weight that you will put towards muscle you need to eat more along with your strength routine. Plenty of stores like GNC sell protein powder that also claim weight gain. Otherwise you should tell us what your goal is so we can better help you.",
            "I have protein powder, and I eat pounds of eggs, oats, lean meat, fruit/ veggies, milk, and some random cheat days throughout the month. My goal is to gain muscle weight without gaining fat. I know that’s extremely hard but I study exercising/fitness a lot and I use it in my workouts, and I’ve been adapting my workouts for years. I don’t get as much sleep as I should but it’s not like it’s a problem or anything. \n\nI would also like to become more lean but that’s basically a no go until I can put on the size I want. ",
            "Cardio and diet are your 2 most important things here, google tdee to learn what your caloric intake needs to be. Lose the belly then start increasing muscle and mass",
            "Eat more. Eat lean. Eat well.\nStart with the basics of lifting. \nUnderstand the technique, motion and establish a well mind body muscle connection.\nThen progressively overload.\nFatigue is always nice.\nSet this notion into a habit. Boom.",
            "I'm trying to increase my muscular mass. Is it ok to do it? ",
            "No problem, I was in a really situation when I started working out. Just focus on lifting and try to avoid cardio for a bit, and make sure to eat literally all of the (healthy) food in sight. Also, be aware that having a skinny body type means you’re gonna have to eat a lot more than the average person to maintain muscle once u get it. Like. I said, I’m naturally skinny so to maintain bulk I have to eat a lot more than the average person. It basically means skinny people lose muscle mass at a much quicker rate than the average person."

It differs from a clean and push-press in that the lifter \"dips\" under the weight rather than simply using the legs to help push the weight up. Each rep of a clean and jerk is preceded by a clean at the start of each set. It can be trained in traditional strength or muscle-building rep ranges, in circuit or fat-loss training, or as part of a larger kettlebell combination or complex.",

            "It's hard to give any advice without seeing your real form. Practically all exercises with free weights and especially with kettlebells have a very strong effect on your core muscles. Also I want to note that It is very important to properly assess your level of subcutaneous fat. Maybe you don't like your proportions because of excess weight. I think the legs rising on the crossbar are the best exercise for working out your flat abdominal muscle. Also kettlebell swings is an excellent movement to strengthen the entire lumbar region. I hope some of this will be useful for you!"

            "Okay, first off I've been training for a little more than a year now. I go to the gym and train whatever group of muscles I have assigned for that day, quite ordinary.\n\nLast Friday, however, I kind of discovered a new way of working out. Fridays are shoulder (deltoid) days. I didn't feel like going to the gym and so I did it at home. It only took 14 minutes and it was the most insane workout I've ever experienced. All it took was two dumbbells at around 4 kilograms (sounds easy, but you can take whatever you want). \n\n**READ BELOW FOR THE ACTUAL WORKOUT!**\n\nHave a clock or something like that handy and grab your dumbbells (4 kg for me). When the clock hits a full minute, [start doing lateral raises](http://fitnessanddefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/lateral_raises.jpg). Do this for 40 seconds, then start [dumbbell pressing](http://www.building-muscle101.com/images/dumbel_press.jpg) for another 40 seconds. Lastly you do [bent over lateral raises](http://www.xuvn.com/fitdirector/Strength%20training/Shoulder/bent-over-lateral-raise.png), again for 40 seconds. \n\nKeep in mind there shouldn't be a second of rest in between the exercises. Rest for a minute, then start over (you can do 20 seconds of each if it's too hard). Do the rounds three to five times, in total you should have made something like nine to fifteen sets.  I did it with 40 seconds the first round, but I could only do 20 seconds for the last four rounds. \n\nSo to sum up you should train continuously for somewhere around three to ten minutes with two to four minutes of rest. \n\nI hope I helped someone! Have a good day and remember to stay hydrated. ",
            "My first question would be, are you sure that the amount of weight you are using for those exercises is correct? Shoulders are susceptible to injury for most considering the improper posture during the day (desk job, other preexisting conditions). Adding too much weight over them will highly influence if you will acquire and injury or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for exercises I'd recommend you start off with these:\n\n[https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/single-dumbbell-raise](https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/single-dumbbell-raise)\n\n3-4 sets, 10-12 reps\n\n[https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/standing-low-pulley-deltoid-raise](https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/standing-low-pulley-deltoid-raise)\n\n3-4 sets, 10-12 reps\n\n[https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/cable-rear-delt-fly](https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/cable-rear-delt-fly)\n\n4 sets 15 reps\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese will help relieve some pressure unlike some of the raises. Just be sure to keep your chest up, back straight when doing these and adjust the weight according to you strength. Too much weight you'll injure yourself. There no shame in doing reps with 5-10kg as long as that's the maximum safe weight for you stature and level of fitness.  "

Performing the move standing up as opposed to seated allows more weight to be used and taxes the core more than seated presses. The standing press is worthy of being the main movement in a muscle-building shoulder workout, but is also a great strength movement and accessory for the bench press.",

            "There are three heads to the shoulder: frontal, lateral, and posterior. Like all muscle groups compound movements are king for building size but isolation exercises are good for sculpting. Here are some compound movements you can do for each head:\nFront: shoulder press, Arnold press, push press, Cuban press, shot put (with a barbell in the corner of a wall), \nLateral: upright row, power clean, power shrugs\nPosterior: face pull, rear felt row, wide grip seated row, bent over DB row on incline bench\n\nIf you really want your shoulders to grow I recommend throwing at least 1 compound movement for each head of the shoulder into your shoulder workouts. Which reminds me, I've met some people who just throw a couple shoulder exercises into their chest/back/legs/whatever instead of giving shoulders their own day. The shoulders may be small in relation to some other major muscle groups but as you can see there are three different heads of the shoulder. This means that there are three completely different types of movements you need to do. Shoulders deserve their own day. Often my shoulder/traps days last longer than any other muscle groups. "

This variation of the bent-over rear delt raise often helps to better isolate this area of the shoulder.

        "Description": "Cuban press The Cuban press is an exercise that targets the muscles of the shoulders, rotator cuff, and upper back. It combines a shoulder external rotation with a dumbbell press, training multiple muscles and motions in a single sequence. It can be performed standing, or as a more difficult variation face-down on an incline bench. It is usually performed with relatively light weight as part of a dynamic warm-up for upper-body lifting.",

            "\nToo many weight lifters I have encountered in my years of being a personal trainer who have attempted to strengthen their rotator cuffs but ended up just doing an isometric bicep hold as I demonstrated in the beginning of this tutorial.  So, I thought it would be a good idea to explain why that exercise doesn't work as you think it does and give you variations that actually activate the intended muscles.\nRotator Cuffs are the deep muscles located beneath your superficial muscles of your upper back as well as shoulders and are responsible for alot of the stabilization in your shoulder girdle and joint.  It comes into play during bench press, rows, deadlifts, push-ups and basically any upper body involved exercise.  So, it is important to keep them strong and healthy or in the case of injury to rehab properly.\nThis video will focus on resistance band and dumbbell variations that you can implement yourself!  \nIf you like this tutorial make sure to like, comment and subscribe down below so you can view the weekly fitness, tips tutorials and discussions!\nIf you feel like I left something out or need further clarification on constructive criticism is always welcomed!\n"

            "&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeek 1: Full-body split\n\nWeek 2: Two-day split: Upper body/Lower body\n\nWeek 3: Three-day split: Push/Pull/Legs\n\nWeek 4: Four-day split: Full body\n\nWEEK 1: WHOLE IN ONE\n\nYou’ll begin the program with a full-body training split, meaning you’ll train all major bodyparts in each workout (as opposed to “splitting up” your training). Train three days this first week, performing just one exercise per bodypart in each session. It’s important that you have a day of rest between each workout to allow your body to recover; this makes training Monday, Wednesday and Friday—with Saturday and Sunday being rest days—a good approach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe exercises listed in Week 1 are a collection of basic moves that, while also used by advanced lifters, we feel are suitable for the beginner as well. Notice we’re not starting you off with only machine exercises; a handful of free-weight movements are present right off the bat. Reason being, these are the exercises you need to master for long-term gains in muscular size and strength, so you may as well start learning them now. Carefully read all exercise descriptions before attempting them yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Week 1 you’ll perform three sets of every exercise per workout, which over the course of the week adds up to nine sets total for each bodypart, a good starting volume for your purposes. With the exception of crunches for abs, you’ll do 8–12 reps per set. This rep scheme is widely considered ideal for achieving gains in muscle size (the scientific term is hypertrophy) and is commonly employed by amateur and pro bodybuilders alike.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotice in the workouts below that your first set calls for eight reps, your second set 10 reps and your third set 12. This is referred to in bodybuilding circles as a “reverse pyramid” (a standard pyramid goes from higher to lower reps), where you decrease the weight each set to complete the higher rep count. For example, if on your first set of lat pulldowns you used 140 pounds for eight reps, try using 120 or 130 pounds on set two and 100–120 pounds on set three.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWEEK 2: SPLIT DECISION\n\nYou’re only a week into the program, yet you’ll begin to train different bodyparts on different days with a two-day training split (meaning the entire body is trained over the course of two days, rather than one as in the first week). You’ll train a total of four days this week; the split includes two upper-body days (Monday and Thursday) and two lower-body days (Tuesday and Friday), and each bodypart is trained twice. Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday will be your recovery days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeveral exercises from Week 1 are carried over to Week 2, but one move is added to each bodypart routine—with the exception of abs—so you can train all muscle groups more completely from multiple angles. Chest, for example, includes two exercises: One is a compound movement (dumbbell bench press) that involves multiple joints (both the shoulder and elbow) to work the largest amount of muscle possible, and the other is an isolation exercise (dumbbell flye) that involves only one joint (shoulder) and targets the pecs to a greater extent. (When doing presses for chest, the deltoids and triceps are involved to a degree, meaning presses don’t isolate the pecs as much as flyes do.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou’ll again employ a reverse pyramid scheme of reps, though in Week 2 you’ll go slightly higher in reps (15) on your third set of each exercise. Fifteen reps may be just outside the ideal muscle-building range, but these sets will help you increase muscular endurance to provide a solid foundation on which to build size and strength going forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWEEK 3: THREE ON THREE\n\nIn the third week of the program we step it up to a three-day training split: Train all “pushing” bodyparts (chest, shoulders, triceps) on Day 1; hit the “pulling” bodyparts (back, biceps) and abs on Day 2; and work your lower body (quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves) on Day 3. As in Week 2, you train each bodypart twice a week, so you’ll hit the gym six days this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne new exercise is added to each bodypart routine to provide even more angles from which to train your target muscles to promote complete development. You’ll hit each muscle group with two exercises of 3­–4 sets each: four sets for large bodyparts (chest, back, shoulders, quads, hamstrings) and three sets for smaller bodyparts (biceps, triceps, abs, calves). The result is 16 total sets for the week for large bodyparts and 12 sets total for smaller ones—again, working in the 8–15-rep range—which is a substantial increase in volume from Week 1.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWEEK 4: TURNING UP THE VOLUME\n\nIn the fourth and final week of the program, you’ll train four days in a four-way split that hits each bodypart just once (except for calves and abs, which are each trained twice). Four-day splits are common among experienced lifters because they involve training fewer bodyparts (typically 2–3) per workout, which gives each muscle group ample attention and allows you to train with higher volume. As you’ll see, chest and triceps are paired up, as are back with biceps and quads with hamstrings, each a very common pairing among novice and advanced bodybuilders. Shoulders are trained more or less on their own, and you’ll alternate hitting calves and abs—which respond well to being trained multiple times per week—every other workout. No new exercises are introduced in Week 4 so that you can focus on intensity in your workouts instead of learning new movements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRep schemes remain in the hypertrophy range this week, but overall volume increases by adding more sets to individual exercises: up to five sets per move for larger bodyparts, and even 10 sets of calf raises on Thursday. This bump in volume will ensure that your muscles are overloaded sufficiently to continue the growth they’ve already begun experiencing in the first three weeks. Completion of this four-week program now entitles you to go to the next stage."

            "Hey guys! A while back I released a workoutplan I had been working on. I got some feedback and has since then changed the plan according to the feedback.\nHere is the new version - any and all feedback is very much welcome:\n\n**The idea**\n\n\nThe idea with the YBS-workout is that it enables the trainee to turn up the volume per week while still working out his or her entire body 3 times a week. The logic behind this is that some people would benefit from more time in the gym, but would not benefit from working out each body part fewer times a week.\nAbs can be integrated into every workout, and should be done at the end.\n \n\n\n**The workout**\n\n\n\n*Lower body and back*\n\n\nBarbell squat 2x10\n\n\nLunges 2x10\n\n\nLeg press 2x10\n\n\nDeadlift 2x5\n\n\nHyperextensions 2x10 \n\n\nOne arm dumbbell row 2x10\n\n\nRomanian deadlift 2x10 \n\n\nLying dumbbell leg curl 2x10\n\n\nStanding calf raises 2x20\n\n\n\n\n\n**Upper body**\n\n\nBarbell Bench press 2x10 \n\n\nDumbbell fly 2x10 \n\n\nIncline dumbbell press 2x10\n\n\nDumbbell overhead press 2x10\n\n\nDumbbell front raise 2x10\n\n\nDumbbell lateral raise 2x10\n\n\nTriceps Dip 2x10\n\n\nTriceps pushdown 2x10\n\n\nDumbbell alternating curl 2x10\n\n\nStanding cable curl 2x10\n\n\n\n\n\n**Full body**\n\n\nSquat 2x10\n\n\nBench press 2x10\n\n\nDeadlift 2x5\n\n\nOverhead press 2x10\n\n\nBent over barbell row 2x10\n\n\n\n**A typical week**\n\n\nMonday: Lower body\n\n\nTuesday: Upper body\n\n\nWednesday: Lower body\n\n\nThursday: Upper body \n\n\nFriday: Rest day\n\n\nSaturday: Full body\n\n\nSunday: Rest day\n\n\nThe logic is that the lower body workout is the most taxing and the upper body workout the least taxing. The full body workout is shorter and less taxing than the others, but it enables all the muscles you have used throughout the week, and is therefore placed after the lesser taxing upper body workout, and before a rest day.\nTherefore you start fresh on Monday, with a lower body workout. Then you have an upper and a lower body workout. Then comes the upper body workout followed by a rest day and then the full body workout before you have another rest day. Rinse and repeat.\n\n\n**Progression scheme**\n\n\nI have not thought out what progression scheme would work best for this particular workout, and would very much like feedback on this point.\nMaybe double progression training scheme?\n",
            "Please don't roast my ass I am new to this stuff. So I am an incoming college freshman and I have always been so extremely lazy so despite my athletic body I have let myself become tall and lanky as opposed to being fit and cut.\n\nI have the workout video set Insanity and was wondering if it would be a good video set for me to use at home ( I REFUSE TO GO TO THE GYM) [unless I must 😐] in order to become more cut, get abs, calf muscles, and build some upper body muscles. \n\nAlso is this able to be accomplished by summer time (gotta look good for the ladies). I am really skinny and have a super high metabolism so I don't think getting abs should be hard but I just need help.\n\nIf insanity is not the way to go what should I do at home/ outside to get the body I want. \n\nThanks in advance!",
            "Depends what kind of body type you want. You could just cut down now and show what you already have, or bulk up a bit and then cut. You can kind of do both but I would say it's less efficient/grueling. ",
            "It's probably worth noting that training itself does not burn calories or subcutaneous fat. No matter what type of training you prefer, and even not so important with what intensity you will perform the exercises and to what heights you will raise your pulse. It is important to create the right conditions for the transformation of the body, to enhance overall endurance and performance. It is important not to allow the adaptation of your body and continuously to find opportunities to increase the overall volume of anabolic factors. To do this, it is necessary to increase the volume of muscle mass, maintain the health of the nervous, digestive and cardio systems of the body, ensure the proper hormonal and water-salt balance, get enough oxygen daily, find ways and the ability to rest. Only on the way to the ideal health and functioning of your body can you find your personal ideal body. IMHO"

Single arm back workouts as well to match your left/right arm strength, it will help with synchronizing your pull-up. (I’m no expert, just my personal opinion)"

Like, they will raise two fingers on their right hand while doing something which means to repeat whatever they were doing twice on the left. Don't even worry about whether you look silly. No one is looking at you, promise! Your head has to be in it to keep up, which makes it therapeutic. I love it so much I sing the songs all week in anticipation, which drives my husband nuts, so... bonus! Commit to at least three classes before you decide whether it's for you (it is)."

            "To succeed in the fast paced world we live in today, wasting time is not an option. Time can neither be bought nor replaced and taking advantage of each moment is crucial. Though many people may only have time to visit a gym 3-4 times per week for an hour, it is how they make use of that time that matters!.\n\n**Pre-workout**\n\nThe pre-workout period doesn't actually begin the hour before you train.  It begins by getting a full eight hours of sleep the night before. It is important to minimize stress as much as possible during the day because it can wreak havoc on your hormones which causes cortisol to increase and testosterone to decrease.  Though not absolutely, necessary, 5-10 grams of branch chain amino acids and a cup of organic coffee half an hour before you work out may be helpful.   A handful of berries to replenish glycogen (carbohydrate) stores may be added for a boost in energy unless the goal is to burn fat. \n\n**Peri-workout**\n\n A training journal can be one of the most important training tools.  Tracking training progress is essential. People track their finances, grades in school, or even Facebook updates, so start tracking your training progress! Earning a new 'personal best' may not occur with every workout, but there should be progress over time which should coincide with body composition.                                                                             \n\nI recommend drinking organic coconut water during training to replenish electrolytes and optimize performance.  It is extremely important to stay hydrated.   Cell phones should be turned off during a workout so that the focus is on training. It is also highly recommended to find a partner, if possible, with more strength and experience to accelerate progress. \n\n**Post Workout**\n\nThe post-workout eating period can vary greatly depending on personal goals. . The following suggests\nFat loss:  Within 30 minutes of training - 1 scoop of grass-fed whey, 20-30 grams of carbohydrates from organic fruit (brown spotted banana or blueberries). \n1 hour later: organic chicken breast with unlimited green vegetables\nIncreased muscle mass: Within 30 minutes of training - 1-2 scoops of grass fed whey and 50-100 grams of carbohydrates from organic fruit (brown spotted bananas or blueberries)\n1 hour later: 1-2 organic chicken breasts, vegetables, and 2-4 cups of organic white jasmine rice with a large serving of sweet potatoes\n\n**My personal regimen**\n\nMy goal is to get 8 hours of sleep every night to minimize any unnecessary stress during the day.  Don't worry about trivial matters..  I generally have 5-10 grams of BCAA's with a cup of organic coffee before I work out.   If I'm in a rush, I sometimes add a teaspoon of organic instant coffee with my BCAA's even though the taste is less than desirable.   I drink coconut water while training and ALWAYS bring my journal.  I leave my cell phone in my gym bag, but I take my IPod into the gym with me.  Once I create a \"training song list\" I only listen to the list while working out for the psychological effect and those particular songs don't become too familiar.  In the post-workout period, I consume 1-2 scoops of grass fed whey.  If I'm working smaller muscle groups, I use fewer carbohydrates in the post-workout period.  If I have just finished an extensive workout of front squats and pistol squats, I smash bananas and sweet potatoes to replenish glycogen stores for the next workout.\nThere are 168 hours in a week, make sure those 4 hours in the gym count!",
            "**1. High-Intensity Interval Training**\n\n[High-intensity interval training](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/7-advantages-of-actual-high-intensity-interval-training-hiit) (also known as [**HIIT**](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/7-advantages-of-actual-high-intensity-interval-training-hiit)). A HIIT exercise workout entails bursts of maximum-effort, incredibly challenging (generally around 20 to 90 secs), tailed by a phase of low-intensity recuperation. The aim is to bounce back adequate that individuals could hit hard once again throughout your subsequent work interval. In case you're a novice, you may perhaps have extended relax periods, or work intervals which are actually strenuous however not actually at highest effort.\n\nHIIT workout sessions are generally 30 mins or less, though they could be even longer. Still, while they could be quick, they absolutely aren't going to be delightful. As the name reveals, HIIT training sessions are fashioned to be high intensity, and a huge part of the allure is that they are really an astonishingly efficient and effective approach to get your cardio running and lose loads of calories (for people seeking to accomplish that) without calling for a bunch of time.\n\nThat said, considering that they're so rigorous, you probably shouldn't be doing HIIT workout sessions daily. This could bring about overtraining and an increased likelihood of trauma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[HIIT Workout Tips](https://i.redd.it/ombj6binr0j11.jpg)\n\n**2. Group Training**\n\nGroup training (or team fitness classes) failed to make the top 20 crazes till 2017, yet their worldwide popularity is swiftly increasing. Our interpretation of group training is, as a training session for 5 or more folks led by a coach, created to be inspirational and effective for folks of varying health and fitness stages. This might be just about anything from trendy HIIT courses like, to dance cardio courses, to traditional step lessons at the fitness center.\n\nRegardless of what you want, there are lots of perks of group workout courses. They are a fantastic approach to try out a new physical workout or jumble your routine (do not forget that plenty of group training sessions give a complimentary initial lesson). There's additionally a social component-- lessons may be an interesting way to get your sweat on with good friends or come across new people. Additionally, when you subscribe to a program, you're dedicated to your [**workout program**](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/diversification-rules), which in turn can easily serve to help you remain track with your schedule.",
            "Do you guys think virtual training would work? In person costs $50 per session, 3 sessions/week = $600 per month vs. some virtual programs ranging from $50-$200 that lasts 12 weeks. Which would you choose? I tried face to face training before and felt like the trainer didn't really plan anything for me. He just randomly thought of stuff for me to do when I show up and never keep track of what I did. Compare to online programs, it is at least well planned and customized to my needs. And I don't need to hear the sales pitch for supplements. What do you think?\n",
            "So I workout 1-3 times a week. On Thursday I focused on my biceps and had a vigorous training session. My arms have been sore for 3 days now. Did I cause an injury or did I work out way too hard. I know sometimes people get sore for like 1-2 days but isn 3 too much. ",
            "If I do not workout everyday. I just lose the momentum and feel so bored and sad. Then I quit because I cant keep track of when to train or not. \n\nI have never felt anything bad from training everyday. I just feel good and I dont know why some people call sitting on thier fat ass necessary. \n\nJust train different muscles everyday. Its not that hard. There is a difference between training everyday and overtraining.\n\nBut the people who say not to train everyday only work thier upperbody. Seems like someone wants others to feel bad. Because they themselves dont feel like working thier legs.\n\nWhat do you guys think. I need to decide god damn it.\n\n",

            "Hi there, my name is Richie. If you are browsing the web looking for Rushfit review, you have come to the right place. I know this might sound too good to be true, but trust me, Rushfit workout progam is not a scam!\n\nHow do I know Rushfit is no scam? Let me share with you my own experience going into this workout program, founded by George St Pierre. He is an internationally known MMA superstar.\n\nWho Am I Exactly?\n\nI am active in wrestling since high school. My dad planted in my head that I am going to grow up being a champion wrestler even if it was only for state championship. So, being fit and keeping my body lean with weight training was like a routine to me.\n\nAfter high school, I went to college and discovered MMA. I found MMA an amazing sport and since I am so into martial arts. I thought to myself, why not give it a try. When I first started out in MMA, it was unbelievably hard. I had absolutely no idea my strength and stamina was not up for the sport.\n\nThat was when I started doing my research on home workout trainings that are available out there, I found the this workout program online. What got me so excited was that GSP RushFit was created by my MMA idol, George St Pierre. If you never heard of him, he has won many welterweights MMA championship since 2008. That is how good he is!\n\nWhat GSP Rushfit Workout Program Would Give You?\n\nIt comes with a DVD set containing 7 different workouts. Just like any other strength and conditioning training program, Rushfit has three different levels, starting from beginners, intermediate and advance level. My opinion between rushfit vs p90x vs insanity? I’ll definitely choose rushfit.\n\nWhat I like most about the program is how complete Rushfit are. It starts form strenght and endurance workout, explosive power training, fight conditioning workout, abdominal strenght and core conditioning as well as full body strength workout.\n\nThis program also has its own balance and agility training and most importantly for any MMA athlete, the strength for flexibility workout. Other than that, Rushfit also gives you a nutrition guides that will help you achieve your set goal in your home workout training.\n\nWhat I love about Rushfit workout is that it caters to each level of your strengh and body condition. If you are new at working out, the Rushfit suits you, too, because you can choose the intensity and there is no rush to finish all the routine. You do not even have to pace yourself since the ultimate goal of Rushfit workout is for you to let it all out, at the comfort of your home.\n\nI totally recommend you to join the Rushfit workout program, whether you want to improve as a MMA athlete or you just want your body to buff up and show it off to the ladies!\n\nFeel free to visit my site at www.HomeWorkoutTraining.com",
            "Like this article.  Once I finally accepted the idea to start super setting and training each body part only 1 day a week, I was able to start making my daily workouts actually begin building muscle and burning more fat.  I'm no longer feeling fatigued from over training and am seeing more results.  I still train 6 days a week, but it's much more focused.",

            "I've been in a HIIT program for 6 months now.  \nGot in it when I saw that I was going out of shape pretty fast.\n178 cm tall, 78 kgs(fat percentage unkown) I was getting pretty chubby and getting comments on it. \nMy dad pulled me into where he has been training for a couple of years and I got hooked. Lost 10 kgs(presumably fat) and gained 8 kgs of muscle. \nNow 76 kg. 9% bodyfat. (Of course diet is key there)\nThe main thing is about this, is the fact that to me, this type of workout is fun. And when its fun, its no longer a chore.\nHIIT is suitable for everyone, you can scale everything to your needs and capabilities. And you compete with ony yourself. Love it. It simply works.",
            "To begin with weight training a home does not necessary means that there is short of time. There may be other reasons as well such as to cut down expenses of gym membership or the monotony of visiting the gym regularly. Whatever the reason be, it is absolutely possible to do weight training at home with dumbbell workouts.",
            "I will try to make it fast and simple:\n\n1) If you can gradually increase your strengths in basic movements (like squats) and burn subcutaneous fat then your calorie in/out calculations are correct.\n\n2) Start with 2 gramms of protein for 1kilo of your desired body weight. You can gradually reduce this amount to 1- 1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight.\n\n3) Of course, it is desirable to take food rich in protein and before and after training. In fact, the most important constancy and dietary regime that you choose specifically for yourself. I would take a protein shake after training if I were you, so in a purely psychological way I would reward myself with this.\n\n4) Few words about Preworkout and energy shakes. Usually it is drinks with a high content of sugars (from simple carbohydrates) with the addition of vitamins, minerals, possibly some amino acids (carnitine for example) and various kinds of stimulants (like caffeine) or adaptogens. The effectiveness of such miracle complexes is doubtful and you, for sure, can make higher quality tonic drink at home. \n\n *A little advice if the main goal is weight loss. Try to build your diet plan for 6-8 hours, I mean that the rest of 16-18 hours you need to starve.\n\nGood Luck!",
            "Hmmmm, would depend on your goals... if you’re talking about training for races like ultra marathons or Ironman you may benefit from relatively long endurance training. Maybe if you’re muscle building you could do like a 3 a day but you’d want to program in a way that each workout targets non competing muscle groups and be careful about making sure you use different energy systems. Adrenal fatigue is a definite con, if weight loss is a goal this would most likely not benefit you and overuse injuries and injuries from breakdown in form from fatigue would be a likely con... if shooting for a program that incorporates whole day training I’d highly recommend doing it under the supervision of an experienced personal trainer and keep close relationship with the doctor and nutritionist ",
            "Try some circut training, turn it into a competition to be your other times or rounds.",
            "You do not need to take extra protein before or after workout if you are trying to lose fat. Just drink mineral water in the morning and after training. If i were you I would take my meal 3 hours before workout, in this case it will be easier to maintain high intensity during training. And this in turn improves the fat burning effect. Good luck!",
            "The more restrictions you have on carbohydrates, the faster you will lose subcutaneous fat. But you should add 50-100 grams of quality carbohydrates on training days. Training should be aimed at sensing your muscular work. You must perform multi-joint movements. Such as squats, thrusts, presses, jerks, snatches. The range of repetitions is 8-15. The working weight should be heavy enough already at the 1st repetition.\nI hope this can help!",
            "Hello! You will feel and see the difference in any case. A month of such training will prepare your systems and ligaments for a full-fledged workout. It is important to determine the goals for the next month and gradually increase the volume of training load after this month. Good luck!",

            "hi everyone. \n\nI am a 22 yo thin guy and I want to workout in order to improve my strenght and build sustainable muscles. I used to do a lot of sport when I was 18 (soccer, handball and Judo)\n\nToday i'm 1m84 tall which may correspond to 6 feets I think and I weight only 65kg. My objective is not to have \"visible muscles\" but to have strong sustainables ones. My objective would also be to reach 72/73 kg. (I eat a lot).\n\nI'd like to base my program on exercises with the body weight and I have also a small dumbell which can charge from 1kg to 8kg. \n\nWhat would you recommend to start ? A specific program ? i'm really a noob in workout so I need your advice. \n\nSorry for bad english, i'm not native. \n\nThanks!",
            "ok, so just started to workout after 6-7 years of not doing anything.\n\nbefore i started to workout couple of weeks ago, my weight was around 104 kilo. i have a proud belly, that i want to get rid of, and build up some muscles. personally, i dont even mind the weight, if it was coming by muscles instead of fat. i'm a large and wide person anyway.\n\ni'm trying to reduce my belly and build up muscles, which i do have some foundation of from my workout years ago.\n\nwhat i'm doing in the gym: bicycling for around 45 min to 1 hour total, and additionally some muscle-building stuff for the arms/shoulders for like half an hour. i cant do much more currently, my condition is really low. i'm working out usually 3 times per week, usually every second day.\n\nthe workout i did years ago was random stuff in the gym. running, bicycling, muscle-building stuff. i didnt have too much success regarding my belly, but i could lower my weight!\n\nso first questions: can this be good enough to loose weight/belly fat? i'm also adjusting my diet to some extend, but nothing in particular. i just try to eat a little less and replace some junkfood or candy with healthy alternatives (fruit, or just bite my tongue and skip the snickers)\n\nsecond question: since i started to workout 3 weeks ago, i have gained about 3-4 kilo, so i'm about 106 kilo now. is this normal? i cant imagine that i have built up 3-4 kilo of muscles in this short time,  especially since muscle-building is not the number1 priority right now. the main thing for now is to get rid of the bellyfat.",
            "Hey all, I'm 20 years old 6foot tall and 60kg in weight, I'm wanting to bulk up my body, after going to the Doctors to ask for advise about putting weight on and having no help I'm using the internet for help. Do I need to have body fat before I start gaining muscle or can I just strain my muscles hard enough to grow?",
            "This is a little complicated and I'll try to explain things in the simplest terms possible - And I'm talking about weight lifting generally\n\nWhen you work out for more than 30 minutes, you use up all the \"sugar\" in your muscles so drinking a sugary drink afterwards would be OK.  Since you didn't workout that long, I'd say you really wouldn't need it.\nWith that said, after any workout there's something your muscles absolutely need: Protein.  You should try and intake some protein directly after a workout.\n\nIf you're only doing cardio, I'd suggest drinking zero calorie sports drinks during and post workout.  That would help replenish electrolytes that you may have lost through sweating...\n\nhope that helps",
            "You don't really need to work your abs to get ripped. Abs are made in the kitchen. Not at the gym. Tho I do ad some ab workout in now and then. Try and avoid situps. They are bad for your back.\n Most important muscles to work are legs and back. Those are your biggest muscles. Working those will work your core as well. Working them also .Ames your body produce a human growth hormone needed to build muscle. \n\nSounds like you are doing all body weight exercises? Nothing wrong with that. Your still young and growing. There are a ton of different body weight excersies you can do. Once you feel body weight stuff is not doing it. Add in some weights.\n\nFor push ups try doing them from your knees. \n\nTry going to bodybuilding.com. use the body spaces. They have plenty of different excersies you can do videos on how to properly do them. Which is the most important part. Not doing the workout properly will either do nothing or hurt you\n. Even if you are not looking to get huge muscles. You should change up your workout every once and a while. \nI use the app to log my workouts. So I can try and do better the next week\nHere is my weekly workout. (I do a lot of cardio at work so I don't add much into my workout.but you can and should especially if your looking to burn some fat. )\nDay 1 legs\nDay 2 chest\nDay 3 back\nDay 4 rest\nDay 5 shoulders\nDay 6 arms\nDay 7 rest\n\nNow you could change this up and make it a 4 on 3 off. But given your don't have much time. This will allow your to focus on each muscle group. \nAlso remember when lifting heavy is not always better. Start of light. Get proper form. Workout safe. \nEvery week. Either add a little more weight. Or add more reps. ",
            "I totally agree. I just want to be more healthy and be stronger. If I could have visible results, it would be great. But I’m overall really satisfied with my current body. I used to be anorexic and lost a lot of weight, so my goal is to gain muscles and be in shape instead of simply focusing on the weight. 😊 (I hope you meant 20lbs cause 200 is literally x2 me) ",
            "You can definitely gain muscle and lose weight at the same time, but it takes a shit ton of work. Basically, you have to eat at a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat), but you also have to eat enough to feed your muscles (your muscles won’t grow if they don’t receive enough protein, and not just any protein). This will be difficult when just starting out, but it is possible if you work at it. Read a bunch on some of the suggestions I make below.\n\nLearn and understand how much your body burns a day. Consider Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and your activity level. It’s impossible to know the exact amount you burn in a day, but you should be able to calculate an approximation using a smart scale or an online calculator. Got that number? Ok now to lose weight all you need to do is eat less than that. How much less is up to you. \n\nWhen eating less, don’t go too low. You still need to feed your muscles! And the rest of your body. You need vitamins and minerals, along with various proteins. Eat lots of vegetables, and when you’re not eating veggies, eat salmon or some other fish, eat chicken (maybe 2-3 times a week), and as much rice and beans as you can handle. Nuts, milk, and eggs are also good, but don’t overdo it. Do some research on what macros work best for your goal and your body type. \n\nIf you can, I would suggest being as active as possible. This is good for a number of reasons! Exercise/moving is good for your heart, your posture, and your muscles. Blood flow to your organs and muscles is important. The more active you are, the more you burn, and the more you can feed your muscles without gaining excess weight. \n\nConsider purchasing some BCAAs and Glutamine if you want to build muscle and burn fat. These can be expensive but definitely worth it. BCAAs help you perform, so take about 5-6g before your workout, preferably after you eat a good energy snack, like banana and peanut butter if your stomach can handle it. Then, take 5g of Glutamine whenever you are going a prolonged period without food, especially before bed. If you don’t know about these, I’d do some reading. A quick google search will get you all the info. Trust me when I say these are miracle supplements. \n\nFor a good muscle building weekly workout schedule, I would suggest weight training on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and then do cardio/conditioning on Tuesday and Thursday. Look up some workouts, choose the ones you think will benefit you in the way you want to grow. \n\nI think that’s it. Sorry, that’s a lot of text. If you made it through all of that, thanks for reading! And I hope this helps. "

I know it's cool to train hard go beast mode when I was young, and looking like a Greek statue, now it's about being limber, maintaining strength and being content. Rest a week, and remember that your trainer is trying to keep his job n if he make you work hard then you will think he is doing his job, he need to learn that the job is you body. Sometimes he needs to give to you hard, but has to know when to slow down and listen to your body and adjust his grind to dance with your rhythm.",

I can even kind of feel it now as I type this and it's really starting to worry me.\n\nI have a doc visit next week and I went ahead and stopped lifting for the next couple of weeks.",

            "So I'm just recently getting back in the gym and as expected I'm sore. No worries I knew that was coming. My question is, if I work out say shoulder and back one day those become sore then chest and biceps the next making those sore should I just keep on going until my whole body is sore? My soreness lasts between 3-5 days(worked shoulders Monday and they're still slightly tender today)",
            "I think what the person who told you that meant was that too much* workout every day can be bad for you, which it can. Your not doing a very high amount and I'm sure your muscles are doing fine keeping up (otherwise you wouldn't be able to do them). That being said, you shouldn't be feeling any pain in your pushups- perhaps you should take a day off in between and see if that fixes the tingles. If it doesn't, it's more likely a joint problem than a \"you working out too much\" problem. However, my shoulder used to pop pretty consistently with pushups and over time it stopped as I grew stronger. Hope this helps!",
            "Be careful with your shoulders. Watch for your technique, maybe you hump and it creates excessive pressure on the shoulder joint. The load is distributed unevenly and your back also experiencing unnecessary tension. Start with a quality warm-up in front of such heavy movement. I'm sure that sometimes the extra 5-10 kg can unbalance the movement and cause substantial damage to the health of your joints and ligaments. Good luck!",
            "I think it is not a good idea. If you want a bigger arms, then give them more rest. I want to note that when you train your biceps and triceps in the same workout, your shoulder joint is also included in the work and your shoulders also experience a certain load. Yes, arms muscles are small and can be recovered in a short period, but you should think about enough rest for your joints. I think It will be a mistake to conduct such workouts on an ongoing basis. Over time, you can destroy your shoulder joint. By the way, your elbows will also thank you. \n\nGood luck!",
            "I’d agree that it’s probably a tendon rolling over something. Typically shoulder issues from presses are from supraspinatus or bicipital tendon rolling out of the groove. Most commonly anyway. As long as your form is good you’re fine. Keep it light and awkward. If you want healthy shoulders anyway. Without an actual exam I can’t give you solid advice, so if you’re really concerned go see someone. ",
            "Thanks. I hope it stops soon. Is it popping out of the groove due to inflammation? I really don't think my shoulder muscles grew enough for it to be not stretched out enough yet to move more easily.",
            "This sounds like it’s related to your shoulder injuries. The muscles around the shoulder blade like the Rhomboids, Teres Minor, and Teres Major are all parts of the shoulder girdle. It’s possible you tore them or they are just overworked. Sometimes mine get lactic acid buildup after upper body days and I need to use a foam roller to relieve it. I’d try that.",
            "&gt; sharp stinging/burning pain in my left shoulder.\n\nAfter years of sitting at a desk, poor posture, and weakening of the upper body, the ratio between the shoulder blade and upper arm muscles can become imbalanced.  This can happen while running: when you begin to fatigue, the shoulder blade can wing out. This is hard to notice as it may only happen due to muscle fatigue, not with everyday tasks.",
            "Personal Trainer of 10 years here...your form is excellent! Watch locking those knees when you come up...try and stay just a bit more staggered in hour stance (hard to see...not more than shoulder width apart).\n\nAlso, depending on what areas you're concentrating on I'd recommend putting some small plated behind your heels so you're not putting as much strain on your Achilles (back lower part in general) and you'll really feel it in those quads and glutes. \n\nOverall fantastic job bud! Keep it up!",
            "We did a general shoulder pain episode https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/diytherapy-physical-therapy/id1412587061?mt=2&amp;i=1000416504581\n\nAs for being sore and working. I would suggest starting very low weight and very few exercises. Depending if you are lifting from the floor or otherwise and if it’s repetitive would have further suggestions or worries. "

Especially if you don't want to avulse anything. \nSide note, I took off lifting for a good few months and when I came back all my maxes were the same. Then started training again and BOOM, new maxes of like 20lb increases at least. My squat went up like 50 or something crazy. Lol. Point is, listen to your body. It knows more than we do. ",

            "I have the body beast workout, but never got around to it before I injured my shoulder.  That being said, I did watch through it and have done several similar workouts.  I am assuming you have done more than one round of this.  I find these home workout programs provide a lot good during the second and third rounds as you are better able to tweak the workouts.  Body Beast is more about bulking than overall fitness.  Because of that, I haven't seen much else in that category online.  However, if you are interested in a total package, the P90X will do it for you.  Also there is the slightly easier and much cheaper Supreme 90 (on amazon).  By the way, if you give one of those a try, you will realize how out of shape you actually are.  Just my thoughts",
            "Hate to break it to you, you can't get big fast. Not unless you can afford to put the time and effort in.\n\nMovie stars can afford top-notch nutritionists and trainers. They can also do steroids. We can't do these things. Don't get me wrong. You can do steroids on your own but you're more likely to get messed up.\n\nWorking out is like art. You have to study it. I suggest starting out with full body workouts since you've never exercised a day in your life. There's only one guy online that can help you. His site has everything you need to know about workouts and planning your meals. Go to http://scoobysworkshop.com.\n\nHope this helped.",
            "One of the best things you can do to gain weight is a proper diet. Healthy fats like avocados would help. But you are so young I wouldn't focus on bulk. That would come with time. If you look at professional athletes that enter their sport in their early twenties and compare them to their mid to late twenties there is usually a clear difference in size.\n\nFor your workout you should also mix up your exercise. Do abs workouts that you can find on YouTube. Having a strong core will lead to greater strength for the rest of your body.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=O5JTbMMPUUw\n\nThat is a link to a really good arm workout. \n\nMy suggestion to you is to focus on keeping yourself injury free, mix up your workouts forcing your body to always adapt to new movements, stretch (which also increases strength) and eat healthy (this is most important for healthy growth)!\n\nYouTube is a greater resource for free personal trainers. \n\nGood luck with your workouts!",
            "Yes bro, but you gotta chill. You only 14. Have you ever seen 14 year old with a body like that? Let puberty do it's job. Don't lift heavy or you will regret 10 years down the road. You still got like 5-10 years for physical body growth on height. Lifting heavy now will impact greatly on your body growth, especially squats.\n\nKeep it simple with body weight workouts and lots of cardio. Listen to your body. Have plenty of rest. Don't take any supplements now, they won't do any difference. In order to achieve body like in your pics, you need years of disciplined workout. With very good &amp; strict diet and workout, you can achieve it even in a year, but you need to hit at least 16. Let mother nature d it's job. Keep it clean and simple.\n\nBodyweight workouts and cardio.",
            "Trainer here....rest and wait. 99 times out of 100 like you said she hasn't worked out in a while she overdid it. Inner thigh strains can present as groin pain. She just needs to take it easy and only do some upper body for a few days. I'm guessing it'll turn black and blue if it's strained hard enough.",
            "Your body needs to progressively overloaded over time to grow.  You will see some gains from these workouts over time, but you will hit a plateau since you're only using your body weight.  You'll get a decent amount of muscle, but once your body adapts or has become strong enough to withstand the resistance of your body, your gains will slow down.  At that point, you'll need to introduce added weight to continue growing.",
            "What kind of working out do you do?  There's more than just lifting weights.  You can take up rock climbing, swimming, running, hiking, change up your workouts completely, do group fitness classes and more.  Some of those will even give you chances to meet women at them, and if you have things in common sparks might fly.  \n\nVariety is the spice of life, even when it comes to working out",

            "I have been going to the gym for a long time now. If my math serves me right its been almost 9 years. In that time I wouldn't say I am the next Arnold, however I did learn a few tricks. Even though I do have some experience behind me it never hurts to ask the guy who's bigger than you on what he does. So the other day I had the pleasure of meeting another vet at my gym. He shared his shoulder exercise routine with me.\n\nThere are three heads on our shoulders. We have the front muscle group of the Deltoid which is the anterior, middle which are called the lateral, and posterior are the back.\n\nUsually the anterior Delts are the one to get hit the most. But I will try to include all 3 to get the maximum shoulder exercise.\n\nNot knowing what your gym routine is I will break down the muscles into 1 or 2 exercises.\n\nAnterior:\nFront raise - Do keep in mind that the anterior delt gets worked out every time you do any chest work out. So this isn't really too important. I would recommend doing one hand at a time.\n\nLateral:\nLateral raise(side) - Its important to keep form with this shoulder exercise, so you might want to start off with low weight and go a little slower. No need to raise the dumbbell higher than your head. You can do this either one hand at a time or both. I found that you can focus more when its with one hand.\n\nPosterior:\nSeated Rear Lateral raise - Same as about except your chest is flat with your lap, and the arms move from bottom of floor to about your shoulder height. Again this can be performed with either both or just one arm.\n\nThe fact is that more and more people try to complicate things at the gym by coming up with new and more complicated ways to perform certain shoulder exercise routines. In this case the simpler the better. As you can see all three of these can be performed with ease. No need for a manual or a machine, just your average dumbbell and a will to get those shoulders nice and big. For more go here http://myhealthlifeandstyle.com/?p=413"

My plan was fairly simple but it worked out, my diet has been porridge in the mornings, I've eaten this every day since the start you can put some cinnamon or dates in, they can raise your metabolism over time. Snack in between lunch is a banana or grapefruit any type of fruit you like. Lunch is usually naan bread with hummus with chicken. Snack between lunch and dinner is vegetables like sugar snap peas, carrots or any other veg. Dinner is protein time, Turkey, lean beef, chicken with sweet potato and more veg also make sure it's spicy it can raise metabolism. My workout is a bit flexible but can help everyday, I use a old rowing machine for half an hour after that it's arm or core day. I do this 3 times a day. Morning, afternoon and night, with your schedule just figure out a way to get at least an hour at night if you want, again rowing for an hour can help a lot."

            "It didn't start popping until I had been working out for 9 months and kept increasing weight (as one does). 3 weeks ago, the right shoulder started popping, so I Googled it and found some guys on weightlifting forums saying it's just probably a ligament that has to stretch over more muscle mass now and hasn't stretched out yet. This seemed unlikely since I don't have giant shoulders. \n\nI kept Googling and saw one exercise should be avoided to prevent shoulder injuries. So, I stopped doing that one and I figured all was going to be fine.\n\nLast week, my shoulder was popping like crazy doing Arnold Presses, which was perfectly safe when I checked earlier, but I stop  mid-workout and Google up \"arnold press shoulder popping\" to see what could be the problem. I see that my form might be slightly wrong, so I adjust that. I adjust my form and it stops popping, so I figure that problem is now solved, too.\n\nI move on to the shoulder press and my shoulder is popping again. So, I find [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw3r2lytys8) and adjust my form. After I adjust my form, the shoulder stops popping, but I have to use less weight because now the weight is more awkward to lift.\n\nSo, I thought I fixed the problem, but for the past week, my shoulder pops when I do random things like pulling up the blankets in bed and this morning doing pushups.\n\nIt doesn't feel like it's popping out of joint, but it feels a little weird. I can move my arm up and get it to kind of grind/crunch pretty easily (so I avoid doing that)... but what's going on? Do I have to rest and lose all the progress I made over the last 9 months?\n\nI'm guessing there's some kind of inflammation from the shoulder rubbing the wrong way. It's strange that it's just one shoulder. The other shoulder I can move all the same ways and there's no grinding, crunching or popping noise at all.",

It occurs in the same way as stinging in the abs, just in a weird location. \n\nIn the same place I feel a sting sometimes when I'm eating, and especially when I'm drinking lemonade. I have yet to understand how running and coke affect the same place in my shoulder, but maybe somebody has an idea? ",

I see young guys get on the bench, do 65 lbs times 7 relatively easily and then they repeat that for 5 sets. That's not lifting, that's cardio. You have to train your mind that you are going to push as much weight as you possibly can without dropping the bar on your neck. You have to do that with every exercise and you have to do the exercises that you don't want to (squats, dead lifts, etc). That's why the big guys at the gym are grunting - cause they are pushing as hard as they possibly can. You need to be sore the next day. And on top of that you need lots of protein. Now, someone will come along and say all of the above is BS - it's not - it's tried and true and there are no shortcuts.

I would like muscle tone more than muscle strength and I definitely want to lose at least 20 lbs.\n\nI have started a diet that I guess is what you could call \"paleo\". I drink too much soda and eat out too much so those are the first things to cross off of my list. Apart from that, I just try to not eat super carby food like bread, eat more fruit and veggies, that kind of thing, and replace all liquids with water.\n\nI woke up 3 days ago and just started doing things that I thought would qualify as a workout or at least make me sweat a lot; mostly things I remember from school or watching people here and there. Here's my general concept: First, I try to do a few stretches and incorporate some of the few yoga poses that I think I know into a stretchy warmup. My legs are completely inflexible so I focus more on stretching them and just try to limber up my upper body. I will then alternate between jumping jacks, burpees, pushups, and crunches until I pretty much feel like I'm going to pass out, my goal right now is to be able to do two sets of all of them.\n\nWhich brings me to my biggest conflict: breathing. I don't know if maybe I have some kind of asthma but I quickly feel lightheaded and have to stop to catch my breath, put my head between my knees, and chill for a second before I start the next exercise. I also make a point to go on a walk for at least a mile immediately after I stop working out.\n\nSo TLDR; I'm looking for advice on a breathing technique I can employ while I'm working out (apart from exhale while contracting) something that will help me after I figure out if i actually have asthma. And I'm looking for exercise suggestions that are easy to do at home and don't require any equipment (I don't have a pullup bar). And really any other advice you want to throw my way regarding anything health wise.",

I'm thinking because I sit at a desk and use a mouse all day, which causes forearm muscle shortening as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT-1mQSE3lw).\n\nFor the last week, I put the flexbar away and just did the stretching exercise for forearm shortening described in that second video. It did not work so great. I just picked up the flexbar again today and the pain really went away much more and faster.\n\nSo... doesn't seem to be \"forearm muscle shortening,\" I guess. The guy in that second video was so convincing and made it sound like such a common problem, I loved the idea that a simple stretch a couple times a day would get rid of it. But, it's not that.\n\nApparently, it's Golfer's Elbow...which is why the flexbar routine from the first video works.\n\nAnd I know it came from working out because the pain gradually increased since I started working out last May. I believe it began from curling weight that was possibly too heavy as well as upright rows that were possibly too heavy, but I stopped doing upright rows completely and brought the weight down on my curls over a month ago and started doing really slow reps instead. The pain is still there. I just did some curls with 15lb dumbbells (super easy) and that right forearm hurt with each rep.\n\nIs this tendonitis? Do I have to quit working out? The guy in that second video made it sound SO COMMON that I don't want to believe I have to quit working out just to heal my tendon, but I don't want to keep making this [apparently] Golfer's Elbow even worse.\n\n---\n\nE: answering my own question with this guy's tips for future reference: https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=5451243\n\n&gt; here is how i recovered 100%....\n\n&gt; taking the month off of lifting was key to the healing. all of my muscles needed time to recover, especially my tendons (all of them). i started doing negative bicep exercises (if you dont know what negatives are, google it.) i stayed very light still on the weight of curls. i iced my tendonitis everyday, twice a day. this was the BIGGEST thing in recovery. tendonitis is inflammation, icing it calms the inflamed tendons. i started taking Glucosamine/Chondroitin twice a day. i started eating lots of fruits, vegetables, and nuts. getting nutrients from these foods was essential i believe. i took fish oil 3 times a day. i was patient. every time i was lifting bicep/back i wanted to push my limits and see if i could get my weight up faster but i had to resist this. i curled 15lb dumbbells in the gym for weeks (and it was very embarassing for a guy who shoulder presses 90lb dumbbells with ease). i stopped doing exercises that hurt. no more reverse-grip curls, no more hammer curls. my motto now is if an exercise hurts or doesnt feel quite right, i stop doing it immediately. no matter how much someone is yacking in your ear how its \"THE BEST EXERCISE FOR MASS$@&amp;*(!\" its not worth injury.\n\n&gt; i truly thought that i was stuck with this injury for the rest of my life and thought that it would impair my weightlifting forever. i spent a lot of time trying to find out how to recover from this injury, so i hope this can help people out there that are suffering from the same injury.\n\n---\n\nMeh, so I guess I have to stop with the curls for a while. :\\ Pretty sure that's the only exercise that's causing my arm to hurt, not the pushups or arnold presses.\n\n\nE2: May be tendonOSIS if ice is not helping... https://baseballthinktank.com/are-you-sure-its-tendonitis-heres-how-you-can-tell",

That example sets you right up to inform about \"what sorts of foods items we must be taking in to improve performance\". Develop a household interpretation of healthy and balanced meals, and pursue them. It really helps to compare high-octane fuel (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, nuts and seeds, and also healthy proteins) and once-in-a-while foods such as chips and biscuits. Never outlaw specific foods or make restricted foods rewards though, since doing this can lead children to sneak, stockpile or overindulge on restricted products.\n\n**Blaze a trail**\n\nYou are your youngster's 1st example when it comes to how to live a well-balanced lifestyle and look after your body. In case you're worried about your child's body weight, you need to modify your personal consuming and exercise patterns as well. Think about a few improvements you can come up with together, regardless if it's dropping sugar-sweetened refreshments or staying away from junk food. According to a new investigation, when it comes to youngsters ages 2 to 5, snack food consumes 28 percent of overall calorie consumption. And snack times explain 47 percent of refreshments taken in daily. So it's vital to make snacking matter nutritionally.\n\n**Make activity a household social occasion**\n\nSet a [weekly physical-activity objective](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/diversification-rules). This could possibly incorporate family walks, bicycle trips, activities of football or Frisbee, or anything else your youngsters enjoy. If they're into video games, get one which's dance-based or includes a few other movement-oriented activity every person can take pleasure in.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/vrv1xavv1br11.jpg\n\n**Give praises for their work.**\n\nAs opposed to paying attention to outcomes of the improvements your kid is helping make, provide constructive feedback about how much they're trying. Also teens are frantic for positive affirmation from their families.\n\n**Stay on top of social networks.**\n\nMultiple research studies report likely powerful negative affiliations among social media visibility and kids' body perception. But 2017 study discovered that favorable adult impact and a helpful school atmosphere go a long way towards alleviating damaging results amongst girls ages 12 to 14.

            "If you are building muscle, you definitely need protein powder.  Remember that you can exercise all the time, however you have to watch your nutrition too.  Cutting carbs along with cardio will do much better than not cutting at all.  Just remember, when you cut carbs you may feel a little weaker than normal, this is fine.  It's your body getting used to a lower carb intake.  Also, Having cardio days often like that will cause your body to get used to it.  To keep things guessing add some HIIT like ChristianYAcevedo said.  I wouldn't do more than 3 days a week and add some weight lifting days in between.  Just remember no extreme lifting such as squats and heavy shoulder presses, It may hurt your spine.\n\nAs for my decision with your question, I would stray away from protein powder if you can.  Always try to eat your calories.  Drinking protein as a meal isn't as satisfying as eating something solid.  Like I said earlier, nutrition is key to losing weight.  Always cut out anything with bleached flour in it, like white bread, crackers, etc.  Replace them with whole grains.  But keep those at a minimum if you want a low carb diet.\n\nI don't want to write a novel, but hopefully this will help your decision. Good Luck!",

It's a great way to lose weight but that's not what you're trying to achieve here.  15mins on the treadmill is all you need to get the blood flowing then get stuck into the weights.\n\n5) Finally, DIET\nNo choco bars, processed rubbish or fast foods - try to keep it clean and healthy but everyone's allowed the odd luxury ;)\n\nGood luck!",

            "Props to you, it looks like other people have already gone into some depth, so I'll just add some of my thoughts.\n\nEat 3 meals a day, don't snack. Breakfast gets your metabolism going for the day, getting your body into the \"mindset\" of burning fat rather than storing it. Incorporate a lot of plants into your diet, learn to love those veggies! Eat protein-rich meats like chicken and Turkey. Eat better, not less. Eating less screws with your system and tells your body to store up because you're not getting as much as you used to. \n\nGet into the mindset that you are a healthy person, and stay there. This is a lifestyle choice, not just a phase. Squeeze in little mini workouts in your downtime. See how many pushups you can do in a minute, how many crunches, etc. Be conscious of how you spend your time, if you're sitting around for a long time get up and go for a walk around the neighborhood, squeeze a workout in.\n\nDon't let anyone else hold you back. Tell your parents your goals, if they support you that's great, if not, don't let them push you in a different direction. It can be hard at first, and it might feel like people are judging you, but don't let that bother you. You're doing this for you, not for anyone else.\n\nBe aware that muscle weighs more than fat, so as you become more fit you might not notice as much weight loss as you expect. Keep passing through that, you'll get where you want to be as long as you dedicate yourself to it and keep working at it.\n\nAs for exercises, just find the point where you can't do anymore, and set a point above that as your goal. Work up to it, when you finally reach that goal, make a new one. Always stay positive, it's going to take work but you can do it!",

            "I was in the same boat, I thought I couldn't lose weight, and it took a big toll on me. I kinda messed up by not tracking my progress enough, but I do know in April I weighed 170 lbs or more (and was 156 lbs 6 weeks ago, now I'm 135). My weight loss was a very healthy way, there was days I was too full from eating my meal prep meals. I just made sure to work out a lot, I do realize not many people can workout 2 times a day and do 30-40 mins cardio and an hour of strength training. But start off with 30 mins cardio session and push ups (knee push-ups or push ups are amazing for your core and arms). \n\nAlso I'm getting older (pushing 30,) and my metabolism is slowing down. Here's a few tips you can use. I can't urge you enough to continue working out, once you slip, it's harder to get back. In the last 6 weeks, I lost 20 lbs without any skinny tea or pill. Take a picture of yourself right now, you're going to want to track your progress. I can't even tell you how amazing it felt to compare my pics after 4 weeks, and even after 6 weeks! \n\nI made sure I did a 30-40 min cardio session in the morning on an empty stomach. It could be dancing, biking, speed walking, running, just anything to get your heart rate up and you sweaty. Interval training is great too! (Interval training example= Run for 45 seconds and then walk for 30-40 seconds). Research and my personal experience has shown that a fasted cardio session is more effective in revving up your metabolism and boosting fat loss. I made sure I work out 5-6 times a week, and NO cheat meals (hard part, but not impossible). Losing weight is not about eating less, but enough to nourish our bodies in a smart way so you're not putting it in shock or starvation mode (your body will store your food as fat if you starve it too much). Anything you like, you can make a healthy version of it! Trust me, Google comes in handy for this. Eating less is not going to help you physically or mentally, and it's not healthy. You don't want to lose weight to look good, but to live long and healthy! \n\nThe best way to eat healthier is to meal prep, and make sure you eat meat and veggies, and 1/2 cup of carbs in the lunch or morning. Examples of meal prep for the week could be healthy breakfast burritos, salad for lunch, protein shake as 2 of your snacks (get a low carb powder formula). And meat and veggies for dinner. The more you learn about eating smart, the bigger difference you will see in your attitude and health. Water is really important, I had a hard time drinking a gallon of water so I would brew green tea and lemon tea, ice it and throw it in a pitcher and throw in some fruits, and it would taste amazing and help me get my gallon of water in every day.

Here's a few tips you can use. I can't urge you enough to continue working out, once you slip, it's harder to get back. In the last 6 weeks, I lost 20 lbs without any skinny tea or pill. Take a picture of yourself right now, you're going to want to track your progress. I can't even tell you how amazing it felt to compare my pics after 4 weeks, and even after 6 weeks! \n\nI made sure I did a 30-40 min cardio session in the morning on an empty stomach. It could be dancing, biking, speed walking, running, just anything to get your heart rate up and you sweaty. Interval training is great too! (Interval training example= Run for 45 seconds and then walk for 30-40 seconds). Research and my personal experience has shown that a fasted cardio session is more effective in revving up your metabolism and boosting fat loss. I made sure I work out 5-6 times a week, and NO cheat meals (hard part, but not impossible). \n\nLet Google and YouTube be your personal trainer! But basic thing is, get cardio in, and strength training as well, maybe ask a friend, or watch a few YouTube videos focused on leg workouts, arm workouts, abs, etc. if you can't get weights, there's plenty of videos that have workouts without weights. \n\nThe best way to eat healthier is to meal prep, and make sure you eat meat and veggies, and 1/2 cup of carbs in the lunch or morning. Examples of meal prep for the week could be healthy breakfast burritos, salad for lunch, protein shake as 2 of your snacks (get a low carb powder formula). And meat and veggies for dinner. The more you learn about eating smart, the bigger difference you will see in your attitude and health. Water is really important, I had a hard time drinking a gallon of water so I would brew green tea and lemon tea, ice it and throw it in a pitcher and throw in some fruits, and it would taste amazing and help me get my gallon of water in every day.

Fisrt of all make vacuum exercise all the time you can (50 times a day minimum). Then get up early in the morning and go for a long walk - 20 miles minimum!  Select an interesting and challenging route. Excellent enhance the effect is a great presence of oxygen in the air, so your route must include a lot of greens. You can also take an extra weight with you to enhance the effect. You will be able to do at least 2 of \"walking\" approaches in 4 days. You have to completely eliminate carbohydrates from your diet. Reduce your daily calories in the days of rest to 1000 and in \"walking days\" to 1500. Foods with high fat in the first half of the day and the food is high in protein content in the second half of the day. Not less than 3 liters of water, will only get better if you can drink more.

            "I used to be concerned about my weight. I'm 5'11\" and weighed around 200 lbs. I cut back on what I was eating and after a month of watching my consumption my appetite shrunk and now I can go almost all day eating very little and still feeling full with all the energy I need. Add a couple cardio exercises a week (I do biking) and I've dropped almost 20 lbs in 6 weeks. All be it you have to make sure you're not eating the wrong things. But it's doable. Most weight loss comes from cutting back on calories not exercise. Exercise is mostly beneficial to heart health and long term fitness. \n\nEdit: through my day I eat small portions of things. Like an apple for breakfast with some sort of deli meat. And then lunch is a protein bar.. dinner is the only major meal I eat and even then I'm never extremely hungry. ",
            "I hate running. Hahaha. Some form of cardio is good. I choose not to run, but I still get something in. Maybe rows or a bike. I'd still do the ab exercises. Do all sorts of varieties. I'm not one to isolate cause I'm not a body builder. More of a functional exercise person. Like I'd do squats to add to my core workout for example. \n\nSo to answer your question: don't skip cardio. Still do abs. Maybe not the same day. Idk your routine. Fit it in where it makes sense. Like I wouldn't do abs before running. It'd be hard to breathe. Lol. ",

            "Totally depends on goals. If you want the stamina to be able to do everything quickly with most likely fast twitch fibers then that's the area of doing an hour workout in 30. Which is great progress. There's also being able to control functional movements slowly. Say bench/push ups for example. If I can do 10 reps of a weight easily quickly, it's way more difficult to do those ten reps slowly. Like a four sec count per rep. \n\nIf you're doing a circuit type thing where you're going from exercise to exercise then that's a little different. Almost like hardcore cardio. Lol. ",
            "Definitely start small. A super common reason people fail at regular exercise is because they start off with more than they should and get down on themselves for not being able to do it. That situation needs to get rid of the ego. Anyway, a solid goal at first would be to just go to the gym/workout consistently. However many days you're doing roughly the same time each day. After maybe a week-month it'll be a habit. Endurance/stamina will follow. \n\nAs for your headaches and flushed-ness.... headaches are most commonly (in general) a result of lack of oxygen to the brain. Common causes are you're not belly breathing, or your ribs are fixated enough where you don't have enough expansion. I'm a chiropractor so that's my area of expertise. Advice: focus on breathing with whatever exercise you're doing. Classic example: bench. Breath in on the down stroke, breathe out on the push=breathe in on the relaxed phase, breath out on the work phase. Maybe grunt a little too. Lol. \n\nCongrats on choosing to be healthy. :)",
            "An excellent result will be a set of 2 pounds a week. It's very simple, you should consume approximately the same amount of food, at the same time every day. You may not believe me, but at the age of 21 I weighed the same 120 pounds. After a year of active training and a gradual increase in the calorie content of my diet, my weight was about 210 pounds. I focused on quality carbohydrate food. This includes cereals (buckwheat, oatmeal, brown rice), pasta from durum wheat, whole wheat bread. I recommend starting with 100 grams of cereals in dry form 3 times a day. It is better to combine several types of complex carbohydrates in 1 day. For example, for breakfast 100 grams of oatmeal, for lunch 100 grams of buckwheat and for dinner 100 grams of pasta. In 2-3 weeks you can add a little bread for lunch, after a few weeks, increase the portion for breakfast and so on. Also, do not forget about protein products, if you need not just fat mass but also muscular. Eggs, chicken, low-fat cheese and beef perfectly complement your basic meals. Good luck!",
            "Even though staying hydrated is healthier and advisable in every aspect, some professionals recommend not drinking water before any fasted cardio (if that is something you do, say, every morning).\n\nIn fact, there are academic studies suggesting that working out while fasting (and that includes water) may change the outcome of such workout session. It may \"make you stronger\", allowing you to lift more intensely when fasting (which makes sense, if you think that animals have to be faster/stronger/more focused when hungry, for the sake of being more efficient hunters), but this might not be a difference that you're able to notice. Maybe just enough for one more rep, or a more complete last rep. \n\nAs always, though, there are other academic studies concluding that there is no difference between being fasting and not being fasting when a workout session happens. \n\nLike everything, it narrows down to what is best FOR YOU. How do you feel better? Figure it out and go for it.",

            "I will try to give an example of the correct combination of cardio and strength training.\nImagine that you have 5 workouts a week with approximately the same load and intensity level.  We will assume that they occur in the evening. We assume that you use the principle of protein-carbohydrate alternation in your diet and on Wednesday you have \"carbohydrate loading\". On the first day you perform a light jog in the morning, the next day the duration of the jogging increases, and on the third day the intensity also increases. On the 4th day you repeat the second day, and on the 5th - 1st day. Then you have 2 rest days, but you need an active rest. So I reccomend some hiking in a fresh air. 5-10 miles will be enough. Thus, a week cycle is obtained, in which cardio, power loads and rest are balanced due to different duration and intensity of loads.\n\nThis is just an example. You need to spend a little time on self-study to better understand exactly how the recovery processes take place in your body and choose the best option for yourself. \n\n",

You can use most types of speed-strength sports and training with iron.\n\n2) Pay special attention to your emotional state. Be determined and confident in what you are doing.

Almond milk is a great alternative and like soda....when you cut it out you'll see much less bloat. Hope I helped a bit! :)",
            "No. The aerobic process requires at least 3 minutes of continuous exercise to kick in and become the body’s primary energy source. This means that for a 4 minute plank only 1 minute of it is “cardio”. I put cardio in parentheses because planks are not traditionally considered a cardiovascular exercise. They aren’t designed to get the heart rate up or be performed for extended periods of time. They’re better for building core strength. If you want to get more cardiovascular benefit from your planks turn them into mountain climbers and put them in a circuit. ",

            "Well, before we get onto workouts, your nutrition is important. You seem to be worried about your current diet so I'm guessing you think theres a problem there. As long as it's home cooked and you're not eating too much any diet is fine for the long term really. I saw someone recommending keto here and honestly it is pretty good, especially if you want to lose weight fast. However you will feel like you've got no energy sometimes and some moodiness mighy be expected. Generally what I do is fill half of a plat with protein and the rest with carbs and green vegetables.\n\nIn terms of exercise, lift weights if you want quick results. You'll make gains quite quickly if you're consistent and don't worry about getting bulky because you won't. The key however is consistency. Since you don't have a gym membership, calisthenics is also a good choice and I do it myself so I can guarantee that you won't need any equipment save for a pull up bar ( if you'd like ). It'll get you in shape, albeit a bit slower, and you'll have a balanced build as everything you do is usually compound exercises anyway.\n\nI'm 17 so I know how you feel but as long as you keep consistent with what you do, you can't go wrong.

Just a better way of saying a diet because of the stigma around it.\n\nHope this helps and congrats on staying determined to make that change. ",
            "I would personally switch up and try to do a little more weights with cardio after since you are wanting pecs and abs as well. Paced running burns a lot of calories, even more than weight lifting during the exercise itself. However doing weights and creating a stress on those muscles with anarobeic exercises will help you burn more over time by raising your metabolic rate for a set period. If you want all this to take a bigger effect, and to see more results even sooner, you are going to have to diet. Count calories with the goal of just a small calorie deficit, maybe 200-300, and do some macro managing. Lower carbs and fat with higher protein. \n\nThis is what I personally found to be a decent combo to cut some weight and get a leaner look to boot. \n\nAs far as motivation, it can be a struggle for everyone. Sometimes it all feels worthless because you aren't getting those results you want. Even when you know it's all for a bigger future goal you feel it's a dead end and wasted time. I personally have no like minded friends when it comes to a healthy lifestyle and working out. So I have to find like minded people on social media to keep the mindset and motivation. It sounds silly but follow some workout people on Instagram  or Twitter and follow some posters on here. Watch some videos that may interest you about an exercise or diet when you're just sitting on the toliet and bored.

            "Doing High Intensity Interval Training on the treadmill would be a great start. It's Hell, but quick and effective, and has you feeling very productive. \n\nWhat it does, is shocks your body and boosts your metabolism for a longer period of time than any other workout I know if. It gets it pretty high/maxed out for anywhere between 12 and 72 hours, which means the calories you're burning at rest is more for that period of time. It also burns the least muscle mass than any cardio, as cardio does that. It's a good start to burning the fat covering your muscles.\n\nWhat you do is warm up on the treadmill. Then, you go at a pace that gets you a little worked up but not too much. For someone completely out of shape like I was, that was 3.5. After 45 seconds to 1 minute, you push yourself to a pace that you can barely do without collapsing. For me, it was 5.5 - 6.0. Do the for another 45 seconds to 1 minute. Then go back to the slower one for the same amount of time, then faster, then slower, etc. You either set your goal time or don't stop until you've pushed yourself past when you wanted to give up a couple of rounds. Don't forget to cool down.\n\nTrust, it will be difficult and epic, and you'll leave feeling like you did something useful to your body. You can add in weight training later, but don't have to at first. When you're ready to, though, simply search workout routines targeting specific parts of the body on YouTube and see how they're done before you try them.",

Everyone’s different but I’m currently on a 35/35/30 percent  breakdown of macros (protein/fat/carbs).  \n\nI’ve done higher protein and lower on the other two and just wasn’t getting results. Everyone is different though.  Also ate a lot of “whole” foods. Cut the processed stuff and opted for more nutrient dense options. \n\nTiming is key as well. If it’s a rest day I don’t worry about getting all the carbs in but maintain protein and fat.  Also last meals/snacks at night are high protein and fat as you don’t need carbs to sleep.  Last but not least post workout meals are carb and protein heavy.  Little to no fat. \n\nWorkout program is up to you but I started by doing a reset with a 5x5 of compound lifts with abs with very little isolation exercises for the first month.  After the first four weeks I’ve started doing more isolation, increasing the number of days reps and sets every 3 weeks.   Average time in gym excluding cardio is about an hour to an hour and 15 depending on warmup. \n\nCardio to save time would be about 20 minutes. 8 minutes of hiit and the remaining 12 minutes a steady pace run/jog/elliptical/walk at incline/row. \n\nBest of luck to you!",
            "In my personal experience, along with friends and other guys at the gym, your first 6 months of lifting it really doesn't matter what you do you'll build muscle (newbie gains). Then that will usually start to taper off pretty rapidly after that. In that time just get familiar with the gym and the equipment and machines, also you can work on form, make sure you're doing workouts correctly. Look up YouTube videos, theres plenty of guides and do's and don'ts. (My favorites: Buff Dudes and Omarsuf). There too you can find detailed workouts. Also make sure you add more weight and are getting stronger all the time.\n\nPersonally I don't like cardio (who really does) and never really do it, I just watch my diet a little closer, but if you really want to do it, save your energy for the weights and do it after lifting. \n\nStretching is also a great idea, you don't really want to turn into the big buff dude that has to turn his whole body to look around. That too save until after your workout.\n\nOut of all of that the most important thing you can do is diet. Best way to go about it is to use the K.I.S.S. method (keep it simple stupid). Get a calorie tracker (i.e. myfitnesspal) and the best way to go about it is to track just calories and protein intake, dont worry about your fats and carbs. The golden rule is usually 1 gram of protein per body weight, if you're a bigger guy cut that by like 10 or 15 percent. Don't worry about it too much in the beginning, just get used to tracking calories and noticing what has protein and what doesn't.\n\nBuilding muscle is way easier than it seems. Hit the gym, eat your protein and be patient. It really does take time, just focus on getting stronger, and trust the process. Best of luck to you.",

            "If your working efficiently I would say about an hour to an hour and a half is more than enough time to workout and get these workouts in. That’s about what it takes me and I do 10 mins of cardio before and after. ",

            "Hi! I'm a kinesiology major with a concentration of Occupational Therapy. With my education through my university, we have been taught to not workout more than four days a week, with two of those day being a cardio endurance exercise and two days of muscular endurance. However or what ever works with your schedule, M, W, TH, and F would be a good example and starting point for a workout plan. Depending on what gym you attend, weight-lifting is my go to for muscular endurance whether it's machine or free weights. \n\nSo M - shoulders, arms, upper back. W - cardio exercise (your choice) TH - Legs, lower back. F - cardio \n\nDON'T FORGET TO STRETCH! \\*\\*\n\nSince you said you would start running, which is amazing since it may be outside. I don't recommend pushing yourself to where you can't walk the next day. With your experience playing soccer I'm confident you already knew that. You said that you work a desk job; this may sound silly but since you're sedentary for long periods of time. Try standing up once a hour just to get your heart pumping a little more. \n\nIn regards to diet, 80% of any \"abs\" are made in the kitchen and only 20% is exercising. Any soda that you may drink, scratch it; if you drink milk try Almond milk or Skim milk, I'm lactose intolerant so I drink Almond milk but it's 10xs healthier than regular 2% or whole milk. It also last a long time since it's made from almonds!\n\n Drop all sweets, any high in fats drop it. Chicken, Salmon, and any greens are your best friends. You have good and bad carbs but I recommend giving a good Google search and research on your own (I don't have a lot of experience with knowing the difference).\n\nTry to only eat two meals a day and small snacks in between. So maybe for breakfast make a bowl of oatmeal, I recommend overnight oatmeal (It's easy). For lunch have a small meal and have a couples of snacks until dinner such as, nuts, salads, protein packs. Not sure if you're on Pinterest often but they ofter meal plans that are easy to stand by! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps you get any ideas, if you have any more questions don't be afraid to ask! c:",
            "Hey there Sadie! First I want to say thank you for helping me! Also I have a few questions about this!\n\nSince you were not taught to workout more than 4 days a week, does working out more have negative effects?\n\nI also want to emphasize I am trying to build muscle as much as possible, specifically upper body.\n\nSo does muscular endurance training help with building muscle? Or does it keep you leaner?\n\nShould I not run everyday and only do cardio on the work out days? \n\nI get up to stretch very often at work!\n\nWill switch to Almond milk! And what kind of chicken is healthiest? Does it even matter? I know not fried chicken of course but I would like to know if a rotisserie chickens are alright or if there is a frozen chicken breast I should look for?\n\nDo you know any websites or other threads for me to look into for healthy meal plans? My knowledge on nutrition is pretty out dated, I know the food pyramid has been changed and that their are a lot more nutrition studies that have been done. I would very much like to make sure my diet is consistently healthy, I enjoy healthy foods more so than fast food or greasy food in general. I would just like to make sure that what I think is healthy IS actually healthy!\n\nI am not on pintrest, but will look into it for ideas thank you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain thank you for your time and effort! Are you currently on a diet plan and workout regimen?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
            "Man for your own mental and physical health. Chill, eat as healthy as possible, enjoy cheats, don’t starve yourself and never feel bad when eating. Also, never ever try to puke, restrict, workout just to get rid of calories you feel bad of! It will lead to an evil cycle soon or later. Trust me, I’ve been there and Im 18 now. It started at exactly your age and it still makes me go crazy time to time. Man you’re young, enjoy your life, friends, family and all sorts of food in the right moderation. Balance is key!",
            "It sounds like you’re legs just aren’t getting the recovery they need to ever adapt to your training. Make sure that your nutrition is solid going into workout, maybe add a greens or curcummin product to your daily regime. I would also highly recommend and intra workout product with EAA’s and highly branched cyclic dextrins. My husband and I use granite supplements (husband is national level bodybuilder). Then make sure you’re getting proper nutrition post workout. Stretching is meh. I’m a yoga instructor and while I believe in the power of mobility, there is just no hard evidence to prove stretching will help. In fact I think it makes doms worse. Epsom bath is great, so is compression and cryotherapy if that’s available to you. ",
            "I am by no means a personal trainer or anything, just another person trying to better their life. \n\nWhat is your current activity level? Do you take walks or play any sports? If not, then I'd say start there. Go for a mile or two walk everyday, pick up an intramural sport or take up running or swimming. For me I need a mix of cardio and weight training to get the results I am looking for. \n\nWhat are your eating habits like? Do you eat a lot of fried foods or pasta? (My two favorite things) Are you like me and still refuse to eat your vegetables? Most of the research I've found boils down to cut the crap out of your diet and eat more healthy foods. I know for me that I can't go cold turkey, but if I make sure to have more of the healthy stuff on my plate, I don't feel bad about eating the tasty stuff. For example, have one slice of pizza but pair it with a side salad and water instead of cheesy bread and a coke. You'll want to look at portion sizes and how much of what to eat for a given meal. Eating too much food, even if it's healthy, is still too much food and will cause you to continue putting on weight. \n\nIt's all about making small changes to your lifestyle, that is how you will not only lose the weight but also keep it off. I hope this helped and wasn't too overwhelming. Good luck! "

What is the cheapest that I could get a bench press set that wouldn't be unstable or unsafe. Also because I am just starting working out my arms should I start with dumbells or bench set? Thoughts?",
            "Not everyone has the luxury of working out on a daily or semi-daily basis. However, did you know that you can, instead of not doing anything at all, create a 10-minute time frame to get yourself sweating and move in with what you were doing. In this article we are going to show you 4 exercises that you could simply with an exercise bench.\n\n**The Deadbug**\n\nHow: Lie down facing upwards, arms and knees facing upwards but knees bent 90 degrees. Then while maintaining contact with the floor using your lower back, brace your core and slowly lower one of your legs stretching out and stretch the opposite arm overhead. Keep this pose for a couple of seconds and reverse. \n\n**Do as many of these reps as possible in 30 seconds, then rest 10 seconds. Do 3 of these sets you’re done!**\n\n**Bulgarian Split Squat**\n\nHow: Stand about 1 meter away from your exercise bench and place one foot on it while facing away from the bench, while slightly “bend the knee” (I know you got this reference). Now slowly but surely, while keeping your torso forward and back straight, lower your body until you feel it pulling. \n\n**Do as many of these reps as possible in 30 seconds, then rest 10 seconds. Switch legs and repeat, do these 3 times… NEXT!**\n\n**Push-up into Inverted Shoulder Press**\n\nHow: Place your hands slightly wider than shoulder width and straighten your body horizontally. Then bend your elbows as far as your chest is almost touching the floor and hold for a couple of seconds. Then raise your hips and press into your heels while straightening your arms. Lastly, from that position bend your elbows again while lowering your head until it almost touches the floor and straighten your arms again.\n\n**A bit of a doozy, but do as many of those in 30 seconds, rest 10 seconds. Another 3 of these reps and you’re almost done!**\n\n**Upright Bird Dog**\n\nHow: Sit tall on your exercise bench and grab the ledge with both ends. Scoot forward until your hips and butt are in front of the bench. Now press your shoulders down and away from the ears while bracing your core muscles and reach with your arm straight forward while slightly lifting the opposite foot (as in the first exercise). Take a brief rest and do the opposite. \n\n**Do as many of these as possible in 30 seconds, then rest 10 seconds and you are done!**\n\nFor more tips on working out and getting yourself in shape for this hot and crazy summer, follow us on Instagram, or check out (Workout Tutorial GIFs) on our [website](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/got-10-minutes-a-day-for-this-total-body-workout-it-s-all-you-need-to-stay-in-shape-and-get-your-sweat-on) light &amp; leaf to get your shot at the latest SUMMER SALE at 20% OFF."

        "Description": "Dumbbell floor press The dumbbell floor press is a multijoint pressing exercise performed lying on the floor. It can be performed either with the knees bent or flat. The floor press limits the range of motion you would achieve with a regular dumbbell bench press, but still targets the chest, triceps, and anterior delts. This allows you to press more weight than in a dumbbell bench press, and perhaps put less stress on the shoulders.",

            "Hello! First of all you must add calories to your daily nutrition plan. You have an active saturated work so make sure you eat tightly before workout.\n\nConsidering 6 work days in kitchen, i think 3 time per week is enough for good start. \n\nIf i were you my program would look like this:\n\nMonday \n1. Squats with free weights (any type) \n\n2. Bench press with dumbbells standings/sitting \n\n3. Dead lift\n\n4. Standing Dumbbell Upright Row\n\n5. Dilution with dumbbells any variations for shoulders\n\n\nWednesday\n\n1. Pull ups\n\n2. Dumbbell Incline Bench Press\n\n3. Rod thrust in the slope \n\n4. Breeding dumbbells lying\n\n5. Lying elbows-out dumbbell supported row\n\nFriday\n\n1. Barbell/dumbbell bench press close grip \n\n2. Barbell/dumbbell bicep curls\n\n3. French press with dumbbells\n\n4. Hammer curls\n\n5. Pull ups\n\nMake 3-4 working sets, 6-10 reps each. If you can make more then you must increase your working weight.\n\nThat will be a great start. Good luck!",
            "bench press, dumbbell flat bench press and dumbbell incline press, military press with barbell and dumbbells, these should be ur focus for chest, flies also work, but are bad for u shoulders so that’s your call.\n\nYour rep range starting out should be sets of 15-20 for maximum growth. Once you stop seeing results add weight and drop to sets of 12-15.\n\nWith not working out before and already being thin your diet isn’t going to be a big issue, as long as you don’t eat cupcakes all day you are going to see muscle growth, if you work hard you will get hungry, when you get hungry you will eat, just make sure your not eating shit and you will be fine."

I also wouldn't recommend any tattoos until you get bigger arms because for some reason tats on skinny arms don't look as good, and when your arms start growing your tattoo would need some patching up."

If you have access to a machine or cables (which works best), 100 rep dropset at the end of the workout will flood your muscles with lactic acid, signaling to your brain for growth. For triceps it's a good idea to do close-grip bench, triceps push down (rope or bar, depends on preference), and overhead triceps extension (cables are great for constant tension).

This is my plan and would like to get some opinions:  \n\n\n* Follow a diet of 2500 calories; 200g of protein( #ChickenFam) and around 50g of carbs.\n* Workout twice a day; once with weight lifting and the other is cardio or body weight exercises\n* 2 days of rest either taken together or divided during the week.\n* Will follow this until i get full capability and start doing soccer drills which will be about 3-4 month from now.  \n\n\nThank you in advance!   \n",
            "After breakfast, make water your number one drink\n\nOne of Ultra Omega Burn easiest weight reduction suggestions is to make water your number one drink after breakfast. Why is that you can ask?  Water leads to fullness, whilst sugary drinks only lead you to crave more. Water is also a higher hydrator and is higher for you than even Ultra Omega Burn slimmest weight loss program drink. Colas and smooth drinks additionally have more energy and sugars than water and may cause weight gain. Even those that have sugar substitutes are not that correct for you, and might be higher off being averted just like Ultra Omega Burn plague.\n\nhttp://x4up.org/ultra-omega-burn/",

            "Hey, congratulations on making the choice to start working out! It will be tough to get motivation at first, but in the end you will fall in love and it will be very rewarding. \n\nStarting off, you'll want to do a lot of compound movements. Since you're only gonna be working out 2-3 days a week, this is the best option. Workouts like squats, deadlifts, bench press will work many muscles. Also do some body weight exercises. Push-ups, pull-ups and dips (with weighted assist if you need it). These body weight exercises will engage your core and make you stronger overall. Small windows of cardio between lifts (for 30-60 seconds for example) will accelerate your heart rate and burn fat. \n\nMake sure you keep good form in all your workouts. Don't let your knees come out over your toes on squats, keep your elbows closer rather than flared out during bench press, and always warm up, especially your shoulders. Nothing is worse than injuring yourself and being sidelined for weeks. \n\nWorking out is great, but if you want those show-off muscles, it's 80% nutrition. Eating right will skyrocket and speed up your results by miles. \n\nCheck out bodybuilding.com and look up Jim Stoppani. He has a doctorate in Exercise Physiology and is incredibly knowledgable. \n\nHope I helped, if you need anymore specifics, like exact workouts to do or how many calories to eat for your specific goal then let me know! Glad to help. Good luck! \n\nEdit: didn't really read the part about using body weight only. All those exercises can be done with body weight only, but as you get stronger you'll need some extra weight. Maybe consider grabbing a weight jacket from Walmart. Also, workouts like Insanity and P90X use body weight (mostly) and are great for seeing quick results. If you're interested in these send me a PM and I can point you in the right direction. ",

Your body will maintain a certain weight regardless due to biological necessities, so long as you maintain a normal diet. So if nothing else, you’ll feel healthier from working out and may even slowly put on mass depending on your caloric intake.\n\nTLDR: as long as you take in more calories than you’re burning, you should put on weight. How fast you put on the weight depends on the ratio of burning calories/consuming calories I would guess",

            "6\"0 148 is slim. So I wouldn't worry to much about staying lean. \n\nNow to get the bulk you want, I would recommend eating everything in sight that's healthy and nutritional. I was about 145 at 15. And I wanted to get bigger. I started eating big and lifting big. 4 days of lifting with one day dedicated to strictly body weight workouts and cardio. Then rest for two days.\n\nMy routine now goes like this \n\nMonday: Chest, triceps, Abs, Forearms \nTuesday: back, biceps, neck\nWednesday: bodyweight smoke session,    followed by 2.5 mile run or ruck\nThursday: legs, abs, and lower back\nFriday: Arms "

If it's any help to anyone at home I have a curling bar, a dumbbell, and a pull-up bar. any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",
