  "text": "So I'm not a huge workout geek, but I enjoy it, so I try to go ~3 times a week. The recommended workout on each machine is 3 sets of 15, and if that's too easy go up a weight but don't increase the number of sets.\n\nHowever, the weights are about 20 lbs apart, so my predicament is this. If I do 3 sets of 15 on one weight, it's far too easy. I have to do about 7 sets to actually feel it. But if I go up a weight, I can hardly do one and a half sets even when I'm well rested. I don't feel like I should be doing 7 sets considering the recommended is 3, but it seems like there's no other way. Suggestions?"

I have strength (I was a lineman) But after these three months have passed I have done nothing while still eating the same way and by doing so I've gained about twenty pounds. Sitting on 320 with my muscles slowly turning into fat. What should I do to lose some fat and muscle. My goal is somewhere around 260 by the end of the year preferably. I have access to a gym if that would help, but I don't want to just lift because I want to lose fat not gain more weight by turning it into muscle.  "

  "text": "Hey, I'm a 15 year old soccer player, on summer vacation, and I really want to work out and get stronger. The main reason is, because I was on JV2 for my high school soccer team, and at the end of the school interviews, the head coach talked to me, and said I was an excellent player, I'm just not strong enough. I'm about 5'7\" and around 125 pounds. I know I'm not that strong, so I figured it can't hurt to work out anyway. I'm in decent shape, endurance wise, but not strength wise. Well, let me rephrase that, my upper body isn't strong, but my lower body is, but I'm sure I could use some lower body workout as well. I know I need to work out, but I can never seem to make myself do it. My main problem is my computer, I'm constantly on my computer, gaming. The entire time, I know I should be working out, but I never am. I need to get motivated, or something to workout. If you guys have any tips on that, that'd be great, but to the main point of this post. I think if I just had a daily plan to go by, I would be a lot better off. I prefer not to use a gym, as I'm short on money at the moment. I have no equipment at my house, other than an elliptical, but like I said, I have decent endurance, so that's not really helpful. If you guys had some tips as to how to get motivated/willing to workout, that would be appreciated. My main request is workout routines, that are available at home, with no equipment. This request is probably way out there, but I might as well try. Thanks in advance for your help and time."

I googled around and found plenty of work outs, but most of them require a gym or that every kid have dumbbells,swissballs, and other things. I compiled a workout that uses minimal equipment(cones and sandbag/any simple weight). Im no work out expert but understand ATP and the demands for hockey. I just wanted to get some input from any personal trainers or more knowledgeable people on anything unsafe in the work out? Also any other improvements like adjust the reps, changing the order of things, or adding anything. \n\nThanks\n\nHere is the work out.\n\nWARM UP\n\nLight Jog 2-4 min\n\nA-skips x 20 yards (3 sets)\n\nSide shuffles x 10 yards there and back (3 sets)\n\nSlow to fast build up sprints x 2, 20yd sprints \n\nStanding hip circles x 10 per leg\n\nOn all fours, donkey kicks x 10 per leg\n\nOverhead reverse lunge x 10 per leg\n\nOverhead side lunge x 10 per side\n\nPush ups  10 x 3 sets.\n\nSquat Lateral  8x3\n\nSquat Push Lateral 2x8\n\nCONDITIONING WORKOUT\n\nDo 1-2 of the following drills.\n\nActive recovery can be core plank, oblique plank, walking\n\nDrill #1 - Sprint &amp; Back \nFace a partner standing 20 meters/yards away. This player acts as a feeder. Sprint towards the feeder from the starting position; play a controlled pass, throw or shot, then turn and sprint back to the start. Repeat for 60 seconds and change positions. Complete 5 times each. This is one set. Rest for 2 minutes and repeat for a total of 2-3 sets.\n\nThe feeder should move on the spot rather than standing still. They should also serve the pass to the working player when they are about 5 meters/yards away.\n\nDrill #2 - Shuttle Runs\nPlace 5 cones out 10 meters/yards apart. Starting on cone 1, run to cone 2 and back, then cone 3 and back, 4 and back, then 5 and back. The sprint should be flat out and with emphasis on sharp turns. Rest for 30 seconds and repeat. Rest another 30 seconds and repeat for a third time. This is one set. Rest for 2 minutes with active recovery such as walking. Complete a total of 3-5 sets.\n\nDrill # 3 - Progressive Shuttles \nLactate tolerance training - shuttles\n\nAn excellent variation on classic shuttles! Set out 5 cones 10 meters/yard apart. Look at the diagram below. Starting on cone 1, jog to cone 4 then immediately sprint to cone 5. Turn and jog to cone 3 and then sprint to cone 1. Turn and jog to cone 2 and sprint to cone 5. Finally, turn immediately and sprint to cone 1. Rest for 60 seconds and repeat 3-5 times. This is one set. Complete 2-3 sets.\n\nDrill #4 - Union Jacks\nLatate tolerance training - diagonals\n\nMark out an area of approximately 50yards/meters by 50yards/meters. Starting at one corner, sprint diagonally across the square to the opposite corner. Immediately turn and sprint halfway along one side. Jog the rest of the way down this side of the square. Turn and sprint diagonally to the opposite corner. Now, turn and sprint halfway along this side of the square, then jog back to the start position. This is one set. Rest for 2 minutes with active recovery. Compete 4-6 sets. \n"

Either at work or school for 5-8 hours a day. Enjoy kayaking when the weather is nice, i workout 3-4 days a week, normally around an hour-hour.5. Most of my cardio comes from random pick up games at the court and playing wallyball for 2 hours every Tuesday. \n\nReason for posting: ive never really been overweight, but when highschool progressed I gained a little bit of weight. When i started working out at the beginning of last summer I quickly dropped from 155 lbs to 143 lbs (expected). Since then, Ive slowly climbed back to 155 in a leaner fashion. I have noticeably lost body fat and gained some muscle so the weight gain (in my eyes) is not ALL bad, though, based on the way my physical appearance has changed, i feel that the 10 lb gain was too much weight too quick. Now it seems that I cant really lose the weight again. I am trying to lean out more and i still have several pounds of fat I want to lose before putting on more muscle, though i do know that at times those to things can come hand in hand. Im not looking for anykind of one trick wonder or any magical advice to get ripped or anything of the sort. I know hard goals require hard work, and i am just looking for any advice anyone has that could help me in my progression. \n\nBig thanks to anyone who actually takes the time to read that shit and help me out "

So this thing is now (re)assembled at my house, but it has no workout guide/cheat-sheet. Since it's an older unit, there's not a ton I can find online for a good routine with it.\n\nI've been doing some basic things on it MWFSat and running TuThSun.\n\nAnyone have good suggestions for a 30-50 minute workout routine I could do on this to gain strength/size?

I've  looked at some stuff on the internet, but I feel a little intimidated because I don't know how to do many of the exercises. \nI guess I am wondering how to start as a newbie. I don't really have any friends who workout who could give me tips, so I thought the reddit community might be able to help!"

  "text": "Hey Reddit! \n\nWARNING: LARGE WALL OF TEXT INCOMING \n\nBefore we start, here is a small taste of what I can do on the court. This is a short video of me playing my friend Fedrick, 1-1. I am the tall, lanky, white guy, without a shirt. \n\n(The sounds/voices are annoying. I would recommend watching with the sound off.)\n\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=781QM3D9NfA\n\nI have been playing basketball ever since I was 5. I am a 6'1 sf/pf/c. I am 15, in 9th grade and made the freshman team this year. The season ended and a decline in my game was obvious. Last year I averaged 25 ppg, 20 rbg, with 8 apg. This year I averaged 8 ppg, 10 rbg, with 2 apg. I had my moments this year, such as the last game getting 25 and 15. The time when I single-highhandedly scored my teams last 10, and hit a game winner. But the decline in my game was obvious. In the summer before the season, every day I biked 3 miles to the basketball court and 3 miles back, and played for about 6 hours a day. During this time, I revamped my entire shooting form (Thanks pro shot!). I am now a great shooter from 3, shooting around 50%. I slightly worked on my dribbling ability. This year my coach absolutely hated me, for a reason I do not know. He loved the other center though. In practice I hit numerous 3's, yet he did not acknowledge this until the last game and got mad when I took 3's. But, enough about my stupid coach. I believe this decline in my game came down to 4 big reasons.  \n\n1. The coach \n2. A ball hog of a point guard, who wouldn't pass to me. Even in events when I had proven myself \n3. Me not being strong enough \n4. Me not being fast enough\n\nTo combat the final two issues, I got a job and pay per monthly for an LA Fitness membership.  They have every machine and fitness area one could imagine, even classes like yoga, spinning, etc. They even have a pool and basketball court. For the last 2 weeks, I have been going roughly 3 days a week, going for 4-7 hours at a time. Here is a list of things I need to improve, and that I need your help with. \n\n1. Upper Body Strength \n2. Arm Strength \n3. Core Strength \n4. Leg Strength \n5. Vertical \n6. Speed \n7. Quickness \n8. Endurance \n9. Ball Handling \n\nHere is what I have been doing to increase in each of these areas. \n\n1. Upper Body Strength- I have been doing bench presses, and free weights. I have only done each of these activities once ever. My max on bench press was 40 on each side, with a Olympic bar. The free weights, I had no clue what exercises to do, so I did 10 reps with a 30 pound weight in each hand. \n\n2. Arm Strength- I used a machine where you lift the weight, starting at your chest and going above your head. My max was 10 reps with 80 pounds. \n\n3. Core Strength- I have been using an ab machine, where one puts there chest onto two padded areas, with their knees on a pad and lifts weight using only their abs. I have done 10 reps on each side, with 170 pounds being my max. The machine goes up to 190 pounds, so I can almost max it out. I have also been using a machine called an ab glider, using it with its max, 20 pounds on each side. With that machine I can do 50 reps going forward, and I did 25 on each side, but could probably do 50 on each side. \n\n4. Leg Strength- I have been doing the machine assisted squats, with 50 pounds on each side, 10 reps being my max. I have also been doing a seated leg press at 10 reps, 200 pounds. I have also done a 45 degree angle leg press, at 10 reps, with 60 pounds on each side. My calves are somewhat small, but my quads are somewhat big. \n\n5. Vertical- I have been doing a lot of pylometrics. I have doing a box jump, with my max being 10 reps, at about 2.5 feet. And a side box jump (Like a box jump with one foot, switching the feet repetitively)  with my max being 10 reps at about 1.9 feet. The side jump helps with speed as well.\n\n6. Speed- I have been using the spinning machines for about 20 minutes on gear 15. I have been using a treadmill for about 25 minutes, increasing the speed by 1 every minute, starting at 7 or 8. This also pairs with endurance. \n\n7/8. Quickness/Endurance- Look above \n\n9. Ball handling- I have not been doing ball handling as much, as the court is usually crowded. But this is the workout I plan to use, Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJEb6O-cjhU Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRRsn_ixsMA \nI also plan to learn all of the other moves on his channel. \n\nMy Main Concerns: \nI mainly don't want to injure myself, or stunt my growth. But at the same time I want to become a great basketball player, and strive to make varsity and become an all-star next year. I really would like to average 30 ppg, 20 rbg, and 10 apg, and would love to play sg/sf. \n\nIs there anything I should do to improve my game in other areas, and what are some things I can be doing to improve in the areas I listed above? Is there anything I am doing wrong? Am I doing things right? Please leave any comments, concerns or suggestions! Thanks for reading! Sorry for the wall of text.\n"

  "text": "*Idk if this have been asked before and I do apologise if it is a repeated question* \n\nI really need some help with gaining mass. I have been working out for about a year now and I don't use protein. I'm 1.65m tall and weigh about 60 kgs. I currently workout about 3-4 days a week.\nThe problem that I'm facing is that I'm able to increase the reps or weights that I'm lifting. However, I don't seem to be growing any muscle mass, or rather I look just as small as I was before. I have peers that lift about the same weight as me and are of a similar height and weight range but look much bigger with chiselled chest and shredded biceps.\n\nMany have adviced me to eat more but I have a weak stomach and can't really eat as much as others do. I've resorted to increasing the frequency of my meals and eating about 4 eggs a day to increase my protein intake but it does not seem to be working as well. I don't micromanage my calories for now!\n\nDoes anybody have any advice with regard to this? Is eating more really the only way to get bigger? Would drinking protein help to get bigger or does it only help with recovery?\n\nThank you to all in advance!"

Then walk for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nFriday: Test day, run as much as you can to try to beat the times you put up for Monday and Wednesday.\n\nSo, would this be enough cardio workout?

  "text": "Variation is often something that is overlooked by many people, but it is an important aspect that you need to think about if you want to continually get stronger. So, why is variation so important?\n \nWhen it comes to working out, the idea is to challenge your body and make it stronger. A lot of times you will see people who start a new workout and it goes great for them for the first couple of months or so, but then they suddenly stop making gains. Why does this happen? The problem is that when you do the same things over and over in a workout, your body gets used to it. Your muscles stop responding like they did when you began the workout. This is called a plateau.\n \nHow do you overcome a plateau? Variation. There is many ways that you can change up your workout. You can either start a whole new program, or you can continue to do the same program while changing out the specific exercises that you do. For example, instead of doing skullcrushers for your triceps on Monday, try doing some dips instead. Do the same thing for shoulder exercises, chest exercises, etc. Doing different things for each muscle every week will ensure that your body doesn't just get used to the workout. It will keep your muscles in a constant state of change and will increase your overall strength.\n \nNow of course you are still gonna want to do your main lifts. Bench, squat, and deadlift are the only exercises that you should always do. But, you can still use variation with these lifts. Try doing different versions of each exercise. For example, instead of doing a normal bench press, try doing bench with resistance bands. Or you could do bench on the floor. With squat, you could try paused squat, or box squat. For deadlift, add some bands, or switch what stance you use. There are so many ways that you can diversify the way you execute these exercises.

  "text": "Just wanting some opinions here cause I'm definitely not an expert. I'm home for the summer and don't have a gym membership and I don't want to pay for one because I'm trying to save money. My parents eat pretty healthy, especially compared to myself when I'm in school, so the goal is to add some simple exercise in order to lose a little weight and get more tone. I'm 21 at about 6' 2\" and weigh about 195 lbs, but with school getting busier and busier I've struggled with exercising enough. I've started to gain belly fat and want to stop it before it gets out of hand. In the past I would go to the gym for an 1-2 hours, but would focus more on lifting than cardio. I don't care about getting \"yoked\" or anything and don't really have access to a good set of equipment over the summer even if I wanted to.\n\nMy plan as of now is to run 2 miles a day and then do a simple routine consisting of push-ups, abs, and pull-ups. I know this really isn't much, but its better than nothing like I've been doing lately. In addition my summer internship has a soccer team I'm going to join. I don't have much details on the soccer team, but I'm sure it'll consist of a game a week and maybe a practice or two. I'll find out more later this week. I'd really just like some general advice on if my plan is solid or if it's shit and what I could do instead. I was never a big runner so no I'm not gonna go run 10 miles everyday, but I'd really appreciate advice on the latter part of my routine consisting of some basic exercises (not requiring equipment, besides a pull-up bar) such as ab workouts, push-up/pull-up routines, and any other body workouts you think would help me lose belly fat and overall just be healthy.\n\nThank you in advance for the advice! One thing my parents taught me is that your diet is one of the most important things, so once I'm back in school I'm going to do better about eating nutritious meals. "

Whenever I do workouts with planks, a get really sore in one of my shoulders and it messes up my jaw on that side. Sometimes it gets so irritated that I can't chew or I'll temporarily loose hearing in that ear, even though I'm careful to minimize tension in my neck and not clench my jaw. I've had chiropractors tell me that I should just not do the workouts but it's really hard for me to find alternatives that work my upper body and core as well as planks, plank jacks, side planks, etc. Ideas?"

Muay thai training, dancing, soccer and running (been doing this for years) but I have never gotten a massage for my legs or ever gave them a nice deep stretech,  and I  feel a crap ton of tension and tightness most of the time. I recently got a foamer roller and I've been using it on my thighs and its absolutely dreadful. \n\nMy question, is it going to take some time until my legs start feeling looser and how long and often should I be doing it bases on how severely tight they are.\n\nAny insight will help, thanks."

  "text": "Hey everyone, \nI'm doing research for the startup I'm working at and would appreciate your feedback on a sports headband we’re developing. This headband will take your bio measurements as you exercise or meditate. Thus far, we are planning to include measurements of heart rate and general brain activity. With this data, the headband will then be able to give you live feedback on how fast your heart is beating, your attention levels, and your meditation levels. We’re also considering an additional feature of having the headband stream music and change the song based on whether the wearer likes the song or not. Visually, the headband will overall look like a normal sports headband. \n\nIf you're unsure why your attention and meditation levels might be relevant, here's a bit of research suggesting that there are patterns in attentive/meditative levels of high level archers. Thus, there's a rational possibility that these factors would affect other sports and similar activities. (For those interested in the papers on archery: http://www.kslinternationalarchery.com/Sport%20Psychology/Neurological%20Feedback%20Experiment.html)\n\nIf you wouldn’t mind, please fill out the survey to help us develop a better product: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SMYMPJS\nThe survey results are all anonymous. \n\nThanks a lot and have a good day!\n"

More and more \nhustlers and athletes are committing to bettering themselves through \nhealth and fitness, but know that the current supplement industry is \noversaturated with preworkouts filled with high dosages of caffeine and \nunhealthy fillers so that companies can continue ripping people off \nwhile providing supplements of little to no real substance or health \nbenefits. \n\n\n\nWith clinically-dosed, fully-transparent, and highly-effective amino \nacids and a revolutionary combination of adaptogenic herbs, Synthesis \ngives you a clear edge, both mentally and physically. While other \ncompanies hide behind proprietary blends to replace aminos with caffeine \nand fillers, we provide informed athletes honest, transparent \ninformation. A powerful 7 grams of Citrulline Malate boosts NO (nitric \noxide) production while decreasing fatigue and facilitating recovery, \nand works alongside a full 3 g of Beta Alanine to enhance muscular \nendurance so you can dig deep, even in those longer, more demanding \ndropsets. Additionally, 150 mg of Caffeine Anyhydrous injects raw energy \ninto your workout without overstimulating your body. Now here’s the part \nyou’ve been waiting for -- the herbs. Our combination of the 3 best \nadaptogenic herbs (1500 mg Schisandra, 500 mg Ginseng, and 50 mg Gingko \nBiloba) give you mental clarity and intense alertness so that you’ll \nfeel HYPED for your next set, but not so hyped that your focus goes out \nthe window. And Synthesis Pre goes even beyond just the gym -- our Big \nThree are designed to give you lasting mental sharpness and acuity so \nthat your subsequent late night grind will be on another level. \n\n\n\nAverage is the enemy -- you see every single moment of every day as an \nopportunity, and we give you the tools to pursue your ambition. \nUnlocking your true potential, however, starts with your body. Whether \nyou’re training for strength, aesthetics, or just overall health to live \na better lifestyle, Synthesis is a game-changer when it comes to \nenhancing your workouts and improving mental focus. \n\n\n\nWe know the grind is demanding. Some days you’ll feel like you’ve been \nknocked to the ground. But you’ll never stay down -- Synthesis helps you \nget back up and utterly destroy your workout and conquer the day. Or \nmaybe you just need to capture an insane pump or feel an extra push to \npower through a PR. Whatever it may be, you’ll always feel in control \nand ready to go. So bring the intensity. We’ll take care of the rest. \n\n\n"

Than college came and I still worked out the first two years very regularly. However when I moved to an off campus apartment it made it harder to get to the gym and I just never went anymore. In those two years I gained about 15 pounds. This past summer I was traveling for work and staying in hotels so I wouldn't even bring running clothes, which made me pack on another 5 pounds. \n\nI have a stable job now in one place and at first I would come home and tidy up around the house, try to make it more live able in. I have a male roommate though who I really like that was telling me he likes fit girls and that if I get better in shape he wouldn't be able to keep his hands off me, which is what I would like; I just need to get there. \n\nI tried to go running a couple weeks ago and I made it about a half mile before my feet started to kill me, the inside arch of my foot. I bought a new pair of running shoes and those have helped a little but not as much as I would like, I can run longer but it still hurts now after about a mile. I don't know what I can do about that? I've signed up for some work out classes and they've made me accountable to going, but they don't work on arms or abs as much as I would like. What are some good workouts to get those in.

Now my knees hurt and I can't use it anymore.\n\nI'm very frustrated because it was the only way I knew how to get a really good workout, one where I can actually feel my body changing. Other workouts I've tried, jogging, using a stationary bicycle, I can't get to a level where I feel like it's actually making a change to my physiology. And I desperately need to, I was very sedentary for a long time and my body turned to jelly, I started aging rapidly. I want to signal to my body that it needs to start growing again instead of dying. I know high intensity exercise is the only thing that will do the trick.\n\nIf I had a partner to play a sport with like tennis, that gives an even better work out than the elliptical, but I have no one to do anything with. So that's not an option.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? Is there anything that I can do by myself? I am a member of a gym, but all their machines seem to be variations on an elliptical machine, that sort of repetitive, unnatural motion is hurting my knees."

  "text": "I’ve been overweight my whole life, and for the last few years I was hovering around 215-220 lbs. I noticed recently that some pants I had just bought a little over a year ago seemed much tighter than I remembered, and I figured I had gained a bit of weight but not really paid that much attention. When I weighed myself, I weighed a whopping 253 lbs. I gained over 30 lbs. in just over a year, and I knew I needed to make a change. Seeing that number on the scale...I was shocked, and ashamed of myself. So last Friday, I walked on a treadmill for the first time in years. Since then I’ve been going on the treadmill about every other day, walking for 30 minutes at around 3.5-4 mph and varying the level of incline throughout the 30 minutes. That may sound like nothing to other people, but by the end of that 30 minutes I am dripping in sweat and panting. I’ve been using an app called Lolo beatburn for the treadmill that tailors workouts based on my weight, height and age.\n\nI’ve also started really trying to drink more water (trying to hit about 74 oz. a day) and watching my calories, and I’m using another app to track that. Based on my weight and height it’s telling me to eat about 1800 calories per day.\n\nI guess I just wonder if I’m doing enough. My workouts burn about 300-350 calories per session, and as I said I’m doing those every other day. To me that seems like almost nothing, but maybe it’s more effective than I think. I’m only a week in, and I know I need to keep at it long term to really see results, so I guess I’m just looking for some reassurance or encouragement that I’m on the right track towards starting to actually lose weight. Thanks for any and all advice or tips or comments this may receive."

  "text": "Hi, which different types of exercise did huntergathers do? And in which order did they do them? Do you think the same as if you would guess. I believe most of their days looked like this: 1. Wake up and get up 2. forage for animals such as deer, wild boars etc. by running with bow, knife and stalking(low intensity) animals to, when one is close enough, shoot it and kill it. then they would lift the animals over their shoulders and carry at back to camp. Maybe they would push heavy trees across rivers if they needed to avoid dangerous currents. If the animal got hurt and resisted by attacking(lets say far ranged ammo of arrows ran out) the hunter that guy would explosively hit and push of the animal.\n\nThey rarily moved in my opinion and when they did they had to due to glaciers, floods and vecause of climate overall. In the move and during the relocating process they carried heavy and light things long ways, because it is not like it was freezing in one square kilometer and tropic climate in the one next to it. Also, I think that the hunting only had sprinting involved if the scenario was similar to this: 1. hunter throws knife or shoots animal with last arrow, 2. animal gets hurt. 3.animal runs but slower and staggers 4. Hunter\\`s camp has no food and so he needs to take down this animal without arrow and to do this he must sprint if he for example hit a boar or deer in the leg or in the behind area.\n\nI would say they did this most of the time: First low intensity cardio(hunting by stalking the animal by walking slowly and quickly, often for a long time) and afterwards high intensity workout in the form of heavy lifting of the dead animal or explosive short sprint to take down wounded animals by hand.\n\nAnd when they moved camp, which was not any daily routine, I think they kind of did both high an dlow intensity at the same time, they carried camp belongings, food etc.(heavy lifting for men probably) and walked long distances without stopping but sometimes they still stopped to sleep, eat, drink and rest for some hours and this rest was prolonged by breakfast preparation and consumption."

  "text": "Whenever it involves training and aiming to have a more ideal form, there are many thousands or even hundreds of thousands of pros and also bodybuilding enthusiasts who can provide you a load of relevant information. You'll be barraged with facts around heart rate zones, weightlifting activities, food muscle building supplement and HIIT. This might sometimes end up being frustrating and not every person who's enjoying their engaged life-style has to pick up all of this so now, we are intending to mention 9 pointers that can be beneficial for folks at the beginning of their physical schedules or those who are effectively on their way.\n\n[light &amp; leaf Fashion Workout Gear](https://i.redd.it/pniu4ljxcg611.jpg)\n\n**Just how frequently should I be training?**\n\nLet's start off by pointing out: \"Anything is better than nothing\". Day-to-day exercise/movement is essential (referring to your guys who have a desk job) and if you are almost incapable to do so, strive creating a brief 20 mins (High Intensity Interval Training) 3 periods a day, around your morning meal time, right after lunchtime as well as just after dinner is not just great to get your active lifestyle going but additionally assists tremendously with your food digestion system.\n\nAs soon as you've hit your health and fitness targets, it would be alright to downsize a bit, yet never ever quit totally. If you want to remain in your intended form, you should try to keep being active.\n\n**What's the most effective moment of day to train?**\n\nThis is an uncomplicated one to address: The very best moment to exercise is when you can do it routinely. There just isn't precisely a good workout time that's put together for everybody, however there is one for you exclusively. In the event that you have a nerve-racking 9-5 job, then getting your sweat (and also aggravation of the day) out soon after leaving work would certainly be fantastic. Many however seem much more energized waking up early, get breakfast and start sweating even well before work begins, your preference.\n\n**What's greatest to eat/drink prior to a workout session?**\n\nRelying on the training session you will be doing; the ingestion can fluctuate. The majority of untaxing workouts, including a quick jog, push-ups, light spinning or perhaps power walking may typically be done without having any additional intake prior to starting and you'll can count on your water during.\n\nHaving said that, if you are about to begin an intense HIIT workout, you will be wanting a healthy snack which contains a combination of carbs and protein (like apple slices with peanut butter) one to three hours before you start at the gym.\n\n[Apple Slices with Peanut Butter](https://i.redd.it/n03lzdo9dg611.jpg)\n\nAs for beverages go, a mix of fruit blended without any sweetening agents will definitely go a long way when you have it 1 to 3 hours just before your actual workout.\n\nThis wraps up part 1 of our **Nine Helpful Exercise Tips Getting Fit for Starters**. **Click** [here](https://lightleaf.store/collections/new-arrival) to get more information and a wonderful supply of workout gear for YOU!"

ALWAYS lift the \"heaviest weight\" with which you have the capacity to carry out your COMPLETE workout schedule.

The amount of lifts or curls may differ based upon the intended outcome (muscle building, endurance, cardio etc.) however, always pay attention to the total picture.\n\nTalking about bulking up however, with regard to the women among us; A large portion of the ladies do not have the particular genes to develop \"body builder muscle\".

  "text": "Hey guys! A while back I released a workoutplan I had been working on. I got some feedback and has since then changed the plan according to the feedback.\nHere is the new version - any and all feedback is very much welcome:\n\n**The idea**\n\n\nThe idea with the YBS-workout is that it enables the trainee to turn up the volume per week while still working out his or her entire body 3 times a week. The logic behind this is that some people would benefit from more time in the gym, but would not benefit from working out each body part fewer times a week.\nAbs can be integrated into every workout, and should be done at the end.\n \n\n\n**The workout**\n\n\n\n*Lower body and back*\n\n\nBarbell squat 2x10\n\n\nLunges 2x10\n\n\nLeg press 2x10\n\n\nDeadlift 2x5\n\n\nHyperextensions 2x10 \n\n\nOne arm dumbbell row 2x10\n\n\nRomanian deadlift 2x10 \n\n\nLying dumbbell leg curl 2x10\n\n\nStanding calf raises 2x20\n\n\n\n\n\n**Upper body**\n\n\nBarbell Bench press 2x10 \n\n\nDumbbell fly 2x10 \n\n\nIncline dumbbell press 2x10\n\n\nDumbbell overhead press 2x10\n\n\nDumbbell front raise 2x10\n\n\nDumbbell lateral raise 2x10\n\n\nTriceps Dip 2x10\n\n\nTriceps pushdown 2x10\n\n\nDumbbell alternating curl 2x10\n\n\nStanding cable curl 2x10\n\n\n\n\n\n**Full body**\n\n\nSquat 2x10\n\n\nBench press 2x10\n\n\nDeadlift 2x5\n\n\nOverhead press 2x10\n\n\nBent over barbell row 2x10\n\n\n\n**A typical week**\n\n\nMonday: Lower body\n\n\nTuesday: Upper body\n\n\nWednesday: Lower body\n\n\nThursday: Upper body \n\n\nFriday: Rest day\n\n\nSaturday: Full body\n\n\nSunday: Rest day\n\n\nThe logic is that the lower body workout is the most taxing and the upper body workout the least taxing. The full body workout is shorter and less taxing than the others, but it enables all the muscles you have used throughout the week, and is therefore placed after the lesser taxing upper body workout, and before a rest day.\nTherefore you start fresh on Monday, with a lower body workout. Then you have an upper and a lower body workout. Then comes the upper body workout followed by a rest day and then the full body workout before you have another rest day. Rinse and repeat.\n\n\n**Progression scheme**\n\n\nI have not thought out what progression scheme would work best for this particular workout, and would very much like feedback on this point.\nMaybe double progression training scheme?\n"

I used to go running regularly, but in January I started to develop a problem with one of my knees, which is still undiagnosed, and I have now been on crutches for the last 3 months. With the prospect of it remaining undiagnosed, and therefore untreated for another 5 months (due to the incompetent and lazy dr who decided there was nothing wrong despite very abnormal test results, and my current Drs not wanting to keep me on the only treatment which actually helps due to risks from side effects-another time), I am having to explore alternative options for my fitness. \nI'm looking to design a simple workout to keep myself fit and in shape. I have yet to see if swimming is an option to help me return to cardio, but I think it will be limited, hopefully I will be able to find out soon. I don't expect anyone on here to be able to help, although if they are willing to that would be brilliant. I am looking for somewhere which is free which will help me design a workout for myself which will take into account and let me work around my problems with my knee. To give an indicator of what effect the problem has: when I am not in pain and try walking there is a constant crunching sensation. Very often it is swollen beyond belief, agony to do much with/has given way in the past and very very stiff. Working out may not be the best idea, but I have lost so much strength and fitness, put on a lot of weight, and will generally go insane very soon if I don't find a way to get some exercise in at home soon.\n\n\nTL:DR: Ongoing problem with knee has meant I have had to give up jogging.

  "text": "To succeed in the fast paced world we live in today, wasting time is not an option. Time can neither be bought nor replaced and taking advantage of each moment is crucial. Though many people may only have time to visit a gym 3-4 times per week for an hour, it is how they make use of that time that matters!.\n\n**Pre-workout**\n\nThe pre-workout period doesn't actually begin the hour before you train.  It begins by getting a full eight hours of sleep the night before. It is important to minimize stress as much as possible during the day because it can wreak havoc on your hormones which causes cortisol to increase and testosterone to decrease.  Though not absolutely, necessary, 5-10 grams of branch chain amino acids and a cup of organic coffee half an hour before you work out may be helpful.   A handful of berries to replenish glycogen (carbohydrate) stores may be added for a boost in energy unless the goal is to burn fat. \n\n**Peri-workout**\n\n A training journal can be one of the most important training tools.  Tracking training progress is essential. People track their finances, grades in school, or even Facebook updates, so start tracking your training progress! Earning a new 'personal best' may not occur with every workout, but there should be progress over time which should coincide with body composition.                                                                             \n\nI recommend drinking organic coconut water during training to replenish electrolytes and optimize performance.  It is extremely important to stay hydrated.   Cell phones should be turned off during a workout so that the focus is on training. It is also highly recommended to find a partner, if possible, with more strength and experience to accelerate progress. \n\n**Post Workout**\n\nThe post-workout eating period can vary greatly depending on personal goals. . The following suggests\nFat loss:  Within 30 minutes of training - 1 scoop of grass-fed whey, 20-30 grams of carbohydrates from organic fruit (brown spotted banana or blueberries). \n1 hour later: organic chicken breast with unlimited green vegetables\nIncreased muscle mass: Within 30 minutes of training - 1-2 scoops of grass fed whey and 50-100 grams of carbohydrates from organic fruit (brown spotted bananas or blueberries)\n1 hour later: 1-2 organic chicken breasts, vegetables, and 2-4 cups of organic white jasmine rice with a large serving of sweet potatoes\n\n**My personal regimen**\n\nMy goal is to get 8 hours of sleep every night to minimize any unnecessary stress during the day.  Don't worry about trivial matters..  I generally have 5-10 grams of BCAA's with a cup of organic coffee before I work out.   If I'm in a rush, I sometimes add a teaspoon of organic instant coffee with my BCAA's even though the taste is less than desirable.   I drink coconut water while training and ALWAYS bring my journal.  I leave my cell phone in my gym bag, but I take my IPod into the gym with me.  Once I create a \"training song list\" I only listen to the list while working out for the psychological effect and those particular songs don't become too familiar.  In the post-workout period, I consume 1-2 scoops of grass fed whey.  If I'm working smaller muscle groups, I use fewer carbohydrates in the post-workout period.  If I have just finished an extensive workout of front squats and pistol squats, I smash bananas and sweet potatoes to replenish glycogen stores for the next workout.\nThere are 168 hours in a week, make sure those 4 hours in the gym count!"

  "text": "I apologize in advance, but this is going to be a long post.\n\nIn short, LA Fitness is fucking us out of $630.\n\nBack story:\n\nGirlfriend and I just had a baby, girlfriend wants to get back into pre-baby shape and she starts to go to the gym.  I have been going to the gym religiously since I was in high school (now I am 30), so I know the whole routine for most places.\n\nWe decide on LA Fitness because the local gym I was going to full time did not provide child care (for the new baby) and LA Fitness did.  Well we got a family plan to work out and pay for childcare, (roughly $80 month).\n\nGirlfriend decides that after a few weeks she doesn't have much motivation to work out by herself, or with me, and would like a personal trainer.  No problem as we have a little bit of extra money since she started back at work from maternity leave and we can afford it.\n\nThis is in the state of Florida.\n\nShe goes on one of those trial sessions where the training manager pushes her and gets her excited to want to do it.  She signs the contract and then I was going to go to the gym that evening to pay for it because I had the money.\n\nI arrived, read the contract and it was for 12 months.  We originally told them we were not going to be in the area longer than 7-8 months as our lease was up on our house and we were going to be moving out of state to NC where our family lives for the baby.  So, we decided on a 6 month contract, just paying more per session.  Ended up being $210 every two weeks.  Expensive, but worth it for her to get back in shape and feel better about herself.  \n\nWe signed the contract April 3 2013, and paid $470 up front for 2 weeks and a $50 processing fee.\n\nWe were billed:\n\n4/17 - $210\n\n5/1 - $210\n\n5/15 - $210\n\n5/29 - $210\n\n6/12 - $210\n\n6/26 - $210\n\n\nFast forward to the beginning of June and my girlfriend gets offered a new job in North Carolina, where we wanted to move to anyways.  She starts July 1st.  So, we need to get out of our house lease (no problem) and our gym contract and her training contract.  \n\nWe went to the gym, cancelled our regular membership just fine, but when it came to the thought of cancelling our training contract all hell broke loose.  They couldn't cancel it, we had to pay the remainder in full, or pay 50% buyout.  They did not have a \"moving out of state\" clause in the contract.  We moved to NC, a club is not local here, within 60 miles of our house.  If there was, we would go, and she would continue her training, but it is not.\n\nRepeated phone calls back and forth between the GM (Harry) of that location (Cape Coral, FL) and the training manager (David) at that location (Cape Coral, FL) resulted in them saying they would look into it and call us back.  They NEVER returned calls.\n\nOn 6/26 we were billed for $210.  Before that I called the credit card company and told them I lost my card so I would have a new one.  Then LA Fitness charged it and it was declined.  On 6/28 They charged it again.  It was successful.  Then on 7/5 they charged $5 for some reason.  Each time they charged my card I flagged it as a fraudulent charge and called my credit card company (Citi) to explain why.  They would investigate for me and handle it.  \n\nGreat I thought.  \n\nThey charged me again on 7/10 for $210 and then again it was denied because I had then cancelled my credit card all together.  There were three charges on my account after we \"cancelled\" her training contract: 6/12, 6/26, 7/10.  I reported each one of them as fraudulent because I did not authorize them to charge my account for the services that we were not using.  We moved to NC on 6/26.\n\nFast forward to last week.  I hear back from Citi, they cannot do anything as we signed a contract for the services and LA Fitness provided a copy of that contract.  We needed to call LA Fitness back. \n\nSo, girlfriend calls them yesterday, 949-255-7200 and talked with Chad who was a \"supervisor\".  She explained the situation and he said there is not a clause in our contract stating if we move we still have to pay.  So if it is not in there, does that not mean it isn't valid?  Can someone clarify?\n\nHe then said he would transfer us to the Florida services because the laws are different there and he kept telling us about \"googling the Florida state statutes and laws\" and he could not provide any link or information to back up his claim.\n\nHe transferred us to Anthony (member services training center) which is not in Florida, which he lied about.  Anthony was a complete and utter asshole from the start, not able to help whatsoever and still could not provide links to where it says if we move we are still liable for the services and to pay them.\n\nHe did say since they could not charge my credit card anymore (since I cancelled it) that our account was in bad standing and we still owed $100 or so.  Which is bullshit.\n\nThey still could not give us a refund, or provide evidence to a clause stating we had to pay even though we move outside of a club area.  Anthony then started to be really upset and my girlfriend hung up on him.\n\nSo, now I have a $630 credit card bill that needs to pay and LA Fitness will do nothing about it.\n\nHelp..... anyone have any advice?"

  "text": "HIIT (high-intensity interval training) might be one of those exercise fads with staying power. Why? Because with a workout that can span anywhere from five to 15 minutes, the results are the same, if not better, than a traditional one-hour workout.\n\nHigh-intensity training has many benefits that go beyond the time you save doing the exercises. Not only will you burn fat more efficiently, but you'll also get a total body workout you can customize to your goals. Don’t have access to a gym or weights? Do HIIT. Need a quick warm-up session tailored to your chosen sport? Do HIIT. Want to combine cardio and strength training? HIIT may very well be your answer.\n\nHow to Do It\n\nA good HIIT program will include exercises that target multiple muscle groups at once to maximize your training. A routine could easily consist of a high intensity cardio workout like: high knees, sprints, or jump roping for a minute followed by another minute of an exercise like weighted split squats, Spider-Man push-ups, or triceps dips. The goal is to alternate the minute of high intensity with a minute of low-intensity workout that allows you to recover while concentrating on other muscle groups.\n\n- See more at: http://www.fitnessrepublic.com/fitness/exercises/why-hiit-is-such-a-mega-fat-burner.html"

  "text": "Hey, Reddits! I'm getting kind of used to this thing now. I saw somebody else posted one of their blogs on here, and it seemed like it helped a lot of folks out. Thought I'd share one of my favorites, and something I feel like a large handful of you are struggling with: program design. These steps are recommended for somebody lifting 3-4 times a week (three times a week if full body workouts, 4 times a week if split body parts [lower/upper]). Let me know what you think! \n\n---------------------------------------------------\nA well-rounded training program should be like a hearty, home-cooked meal. Balanced, satisfying, and makes you feel pretty damn awesome. We're going to touch upon how each component to a good meal perfectly corresponds with each part of a well-designed training program.\n \n**MEAT = Strength.**\nThe \"meat\" of your program should be focused on STRENGTH. Equally important, you better eat that \"steak\" first when you're fresh and hungry. Work on compound movements in the lower rep range, with rest breaks between 2-3 minutes, more rest if necessary. Eating a big steak takes awhile to chew &amp; digest, so make sure you dedicate an equally good chunk of time to building your strength. No need to get overzealous with your exercise selection, or you may get indigestion; stick to one or two big movements and get really good at those first.\n \nExample: 5 x 5 back squats &amp; overhead press.\n \n**POTATOES = Accessory Lifts.**\nYour potatoes, rice, yams, or whatever other starch you like to eat with your meat is your delicious complimenting dish. We can compare your starchy side to any accessory lifts that help keep things balanced. Some general recommendations for accessory lifts may be glute exercises (bridges, hip thrusts, glute-ham raises, etc,) core exercises (plank, pallof press varieties, ab roll-outs, etc.), or perhaps some single-extremity training (lunges, one-arm bench press, single-leg romanian deadlifts, etc.) Accessory lifts may also be more \"bodybuilding\" in nature, such as bicep curls, tricep extensions, or hamstring curls. We know you can gobble up that scoop of mashed potatoes pretty quick, so comparably, your rest breaks will be shorter (30 seconds up to 2 minutes.)\n \nExample: 3-4 sets each x 8-12 reps of: dumbbell lunge, cable row, hip thrust, push-up.\n \n\n \n**VEGETABLES = Mobility.**\nVegetables may not have a huge direct impact on our physique, but they're full of all the nutrients that keep us healthy &amp; free of disease. We can compare the noble consumption of greens to doing the equally important deed of mobility work. Similar to eating your veggies, mobility isn't particularly fun or exciting. It's sort of just that \"thing\" you know you need to do in order to feel your best in the long-run. So eat your veggies, and do your mobility work.\n \nExample: 3 sets each x 10 reps of: dynamic lunge with reach, downward dog push-ups, deep squat, scapular wall slides.\n \n**DESSERT = Conditioning.**\nIf you're still hungry for more, feel free to finish your meal with a deliciously evil Metabolic Milkshake. Perfectly enough, your body usually hates you after a conditioning circuit just as much as it does after you finish off three pieces of that cheesecake. (And never eat cheesecake right BEFORE a conditioning workout, or you may be tasting it again in the most awful way.) A metabolic conditioning workout should be quick and dirty, and shouldn't take more than ten minutes. The secret is to go hard and go fast. Yes, just like what happens when you get your hands on that Ben &amp; Jerry's.\n \nExample: 30sec work/30sec rest kettlebell swings. Repeat 5-10x.\n \n**BOURBON ON THE ROCKS?**\nThis is your optional but highly recommended little \"cap\". It's relaxing, feels good, and makes the rest of your day a little bit better.Your bourbon is your physical activity of choice that brings you pleasure. Love skiing? Get out there and hit the slopes. Into running? Feel free, try the trails while you're at it &amp; soak up some sun. As long as these activities don't negatively impact your recovery, you're good to go.\n \nExample: 30-45min leisure bikeride.\n \nI hope this gives you a good idea on how to construct your own workout plan (or maybe even just your dinner tonight.) LETS EAT!"

  "text": "Hello. I am 16 years old (male) and I am doing the physical section of my Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award for 18 months at the gym. I visit the gym once a week for around 90 minutes to 2 hours. I have discussed just about everything regarding my DofE programme with my instructor, and we have decided that I will be logging improvements in my stamina, muscular endurance &amp; muscular and core strength to see how I am doing over the short term. I am also participating in cycling on a weekly basis to exercise outside of the gym, usually for around 2-3 hours each time. I also walk my dog (labrador, to give an idea of how long he needs!) on a daily basis.\n\nHowever, I need to decide on my long term goal (what I hope to achieve by the end of my DofE programme). I have narrowed it down to running a certain distance (km) in a certain amount of time on a treadmill. What would be a good goal? I was thinking I could maybe manage 10km in 45 minutes if I'm spending 18 months exercising at the gym, cycling and walking weekly. Think this would be an okay goal to tell my instructor? Any suggestions, please let me know in the comments. Also, please feel free to ask any questions if you want to know something or I didn't explain something clearly enough.\n\nThanks."

  "text": "General summary: I am 6\", 203 lbs; not obese but definitely overweight and most importantly 100% out of shape. Like the title says I have seriously not done any general calisthenics or regular workouts since I was in grade school. I am sick of being an out of shape, night-time dwelling, computer person and I want to get my sex appeal back. I would like muscle tone more than muscle strength and I definitely want to lose at least 20 lbs.\n\nI have started a diet that I guess is what you could call \"paleo\". I drink too much soda and eat out too much so those are the first things to cross off of my list. Apart from that, I just try to not eat super carby food like bread, eat more fruit and veggies, that kind of thing, and replace all liquids with water.\n\nI woke up 3 days ago and just started doing things that I thought would qualify as a workout or at least make me sweat a lot; mostly things I remember from school or watching people here and there. Here's my general concept: First, I try to do a few stretches and incorporate some of the few yoga poses that I think I know into a stretchy warmup. My legs are completely inflexible so I focus more on stretching them and just try to limber up my upper body. I will then alternate between jumping jacks, burpees, pushups, and crunches until I pretty much feel like I'm going to pass out, my goal right now is to be able to do two sets of all of them.\n\nWhich brings me to my biggest conflict: breathing. I don't know if maybe I have some kind of asthma but I quickly feel lightheaded and have to stop to catch my breath, put my head between my knees, and chill for a second before I start the next exercise. I also make a point to go on a walk for at least a mile immediately after I stop working out.\n\nSo TLDR; I'm looking for advice on a breathing technique I can employ while I'm working out (apart from exhale while contracting) something that will help me after I figure out if i actually have asthma. And I'm looking for exercise suggestions that are easy to do at home and don't require any equipment (I don't have a pullup bar). And really any other advice you want to throw my way regarding anything health wise."

  "text": "Not for the faint hearted.  This is a serious muscle mass increasing  workout supposedly founded in the 1970’s, in country known as Germany (well duh). It was generally performed by bodybuilders during the off season. Initially it was made famous by the German national weightlifting coach Rolf Feser, before being implemented by the 1984 Olympic power lifting silver medalist Jacques Demers and the phenomenal female powerlifting and bodybuilding champion Bev Francis.\n\nThis German Volume Training (otherwise known as GVT for short) implements an intensive 10 set by 10 rep method to rapidly increase muscle mass. This extensive high volume training, places the muscles under exceptional amounts of stress, especially on the last couple of sets. This is the stress impetus that helps make your muscles grow.\n\n“Strength Sensei” Charles Poliquin, who is one of the worlds most renowned strength coaches, who popularised GVT in the 90’s and gave the workout its name (although he did not come up with the methodology), has gone on to state “this program adds muscle fast is probably an understatement. Gains of ten pounds or more in six weeks are not uncommon, even in experienced lifters.”\n\nHere is a link to the coach Charles Poloquins site on GVT: http://www.strengthsensei.com/introduction-to-the-german-volume-training/\n\nA GVT should be performed for 4-8 weeks with weights which you could do  20 repetitions on a single set or 60% of your one rep max. You should work using antagonistic muscle groups – Chest and Back, an Overhead Press and a Lat exercise (pull down or pull ups), Quads and Hamstrings, or Biceps and Triceps.\n\nAn example of a GVT schedule with 90 seconds rest between compound sets and 60 seconds of rest between complementary sets is as follows:\n\nDay 1: Chest and Back\n\n10 x 10 – Decline Bench Press\n10 x 10 – Chin-Up\nComplement with:\n\n3 x 10 – Face Pull\n3 x 10 – Incline Bench Press\n3 x 10 – Cable Lat Pulldown\nDay 2: Legs and Abs\n\n10 x 10 – Back Squat\n10 x 10 – Hamstring Curl\nComplement with:\n\n3 x 10 – Leg Raise\n3 x 10 – Calf Raise\n \n\nDay 3: Rest\n\nDay 4: Arms and Shoulders\n\n10 x 10 – Parallel Bar Dips\n10 x 10 – Dumbbell Curls\nComplement with:\n\n3 x 15 – Resistance Band Pull Apart\n3 x 10 – Lying Rear Delt Fly\n3 x 10 – Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press\nDay 5: Rest\n\nDay 6 &amp; 7: Start again from Day 1 routine"

  "text": "Last June i was working out, i was at the gym for about 1 month doing exercises routines i found here and there. In the past i had trouble with my lower back from a job i had, but in the routines, an exercise that would pop up frequently was squats, so one day i decided to bite the bullet and to do them, to no surprise i didn't do them correctly and i also herniated a disc, now after 1 month and a half off work i slowly started working again and forcing normally (i am an electrician) and things are looking brighter, only thing is i gained my weight back and more due to lack of motivation and laziness and not eating correctly ,thing is i don't really have the money to pay for a personal trainer and i can't afford to re-injure my back.\n\nI am in no way a fan of doing cardio for hours, i rather do muscular workout and lose weight while my body recuperates (if that's the way it works) the only cardio i can do real long is the boat rower.(but not sure if my lower back could handle it just yet)\n\nwhat would be routines you would suggest me?\n\nAlso,i might add that after popping my disc i stubbornly continued to work out trying to do leg presses, which was dumb and probably further aggravated things."

So I'm not exactly a fat slob, but I'm not exactly a gym rat.   I want to lose about 20 lbs and look SOMEWHAT athletic.  I've been athletic my whole life, but my life NOW, doesn't allow me to be as active.   But with my schedule (I'll list that at the end of my post), I feel like it is absolutely impossible to get something in at a gym.   We can't/won't spend money on a gym membership when the gym that is less than a quarter of a mile from my home is free for being a resident of the city I live in.  \n\nI don't know ANYTHING about working out.  All I know is I can run.  I would cycle if bikes didn't cost $300+.  I don't know how to isolate muscles.  I feel like an absolute ass when I'm on a machine and probably doing it wrong and I just want to up and leave.  \n\nI WANT to get in shape.  I'm gaining a little bit of weight and I look at myself in the mirror and it really disgusts myself.  I sound like a woman, but I even feel like at times that it's terrible to my wife.   Quite a few people snickered at me telling me that I'm not even close to fat.  I don't look it at all.     Anyway, I know I'm rambling and this is really my first post on reddit after joining today, so I'm not sure where to post this.   I don't know if I'm looking for advice because, again, at this point in my life, my schedule will not allow anything.  Admin, if this doesn't belong here, I'm new.  I apologize.  Please move accordingly.\n\nWake at 6am (I have sleep apnea, just for the record and I can tell you that getting up at 4-5am in the morning could be the hardest thing in the world to me.)\nHelp wife with 2 kids (4,1) ready for daycare\nWork schedule is on Mondays 6am - 530PM\nLast semester of school until May\nClass is Tues, Wed, Thur. from 8-915am and 415-840pm\n\nSo basically from 6am until I get home and can't even see my kids because their bedtime is 8pm, I am balls to the wall.  Where the hell do I find time for ANYTHING at this point?  \n\nOnce school is done in May, I'll be finished and graduating.  I don't want to wait that long to get active again.\n\n\n\n"

I changed my diet, lowered my portions and started paying attention to what kinds of foods I was eating.\n\nMy workouts consisted of running (about 3-5 miles a day) because I ran a lot in college and because I don't have the money for a gym, (father of four and owner of a startup) I started doing simple calisthenics.

(6'2\" 165lbs) I feel great, but I'd like to be at least a little bit bigger without being flabby. The problem is... I'm still losing weight.\n\nThe only thing I knew to do was to cut my running back to two times a week and increase my portion size. However, that is still not working and I continue to lose weight.\n\nI've never taken any supplements and haven't ever really made an effort to intake certain kinds of foods over others.\n\nMy question is... what can/should I do?

  "text": "I have been going to the gym for a long time now. If my math serves me right its been almost 9 years. In that time I wouldn't say I am the next Arnold, however I did learn a few tricks. Even though I do have some experience behind me it never hurts to ask the guy who's bigger than you on what he does. So the other day I had the pleasure of meeting another vet at my gym. He shared his shoulder exercise routine with me.\n\nThere are three heads on our shoulders. We have the front muscle group of the Deltoid which is the anterior, middle which are called the lateral, and posterior are the back.\n\nUsually the anterior Delts are the one to get hit the most. But I will try to include all 3 to get the maximum shoulder exercise.\n\nNot knowing what your gym routine is I will break down the muscles into 1 or 2 exercises.\n\nAnterior:\nFront raise - Do keep in mind that the anterior delt gets worked out every time you do any chest work out. So this isn't really too important. I would recommend doing one hand at a time.\n\nLateral:\nLateral raise(side) - Its important to keep form with this shoulder exercise, so you might want to start off with low weight and go a little slower. No need to raise the dumbbell higher than your head. You can do this either one hand at a time or both. I found that you can focus more when its with one hand.\n\nPosterior:\nSeated Rear Lateral raise - Same as about except your chest is flat with your lap, and the arms move from bottom of floor to about your shoulder height. Again this can be performed with either both or just one arm.\n\nThe fact is that more and more people try to complicate things at the gym by coming up with new and more complicated ways to perform certain shoulder exercise routines. In this case the simpler the better. As you can see all three of these can be performed with ease. No need for a manual or a machine, just your average dumbbell and a will to get those shoulders nice and big. For more go here http://myhealthlifeandstyle.com/?p=413"

  "text": "Hello r/workout. For several months last year I would lean to the left and rest elbow on a board on my bed. There was not a lot of support from the board so I ended up strengthening the right side of my back. Soon it started getting tight and I had troubles sleeping so I self medicated with ibuprofen which fixed the symptom but not the problem. I am now trying to strengthen the left side of my back but am having troubles finding an exercise that will target my left side.\n\nSleeping is no longer an issue and I stretch every night (I can palm the ground while doing a forward bend) and I exercise my core (sit ups, crunches planks, side planks). \n\nAt one point I tried to do dead lifts and ended up being miserable for a couple of weeks; my from is decent as I wrestled through high school and know how to workout.\n\nI have been to PT and their advice was to stretch. I have done that and am now looking to rebalance my back.\n\nAny help?\n"

I was a thin child, and got somewhat overweight for a few years when I was in elementary school, but hit a growth spurt and grew into it as I transitioned to middle school.

Although I managed to keep up fairly good exercise habits in that time, the hardest part for me has been giving up things like fast food, soda, beer, liquor. The staples of pre-adult life. So I guess you could say I lack a little bit of the restraint I had the first time I went through this process.\nSo I guess what i'm asking is what changes should I make that will help me get back in shape without having to cut out everything (mostly just the beer and liquor). Should I pre-plan dinners? Allow for a splurge night?\nFurthermore, what are the best exercises to get rid of all the extra fat and tone my body.

Recently, in the past two months, I've developed awful pains generating from my shoulders and lower back. While getting a routine checkup at the doctors, I mentioned the pain. The doctor recommend to stop working out for a few days. I took three days off and then resumed my normal routine, but the pain is still constant. My parents recommend to stop working out as well, but working out is how I stay in shape, and it is something I enjoy.

  "text": "Yesterday I went to a gym for an appointment with a trainer. He asked me basic questions like weight, height, body fat, what are my goals, etc. I'm a beginner in working out, my first time. I barely have muscle and am overweight. However I do stay relatively active. I cycle every where I go. So after the consultation, he tells me \"let's go work out.\" I actually worked out two weeks prior, and took a break bc of my busy schedule. He had me do squats while putting weights over my head, throwing a ball and catching it (not all at once). But anyways it lasted about 20 mins. My workouts were about 1 hour before this day, and after I really tired. Today I woke up so sore! It's really hard to sit down and get up from chairs and I walk weird. I have no idea of this is an injury  or just soreness. The \"soreness\" is just above my knees and on both legs. It is also on my buttocks. Is this soreness? If so, do you think I wasn't working hard enough before this day? (Bc I never ever got sore before this day) thanks hope you guys can help "

  "text": "So for today[ our team](https://lightleaf.store/) have thought of a summary of TWELVE fantastic suggestions (you won't always need to adhere to each one of these) which in turn are likely to allow you accomplish or take care of a healthy body. These tips vary from straightforward day-to-day habits, to minding external aspects including your psychological durability for you to perform to your greatest extent.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/j84gz39bbmk11.jpg\n\n[**Have breakfast**](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/smart-foods-before-working-out)\n\nAmongst probably the most crucial recommendations we can possibly list is for people to get a healthy well-balanced early meal including a bit of fruit, lots of fibers (breadstuff, grain, oats and such) and also water or perhaps a healthy smoothie. It is actually very essential to begin your metabolism processes up in the early morning and grant you that energy breakthrough to become you all set for the whole day.\n\n[Eat A Healthy Breakfast](https://i.redd.it/i94tfiadbmk11.jpg)\n\n**Plan your meals**\n\nIn the same manner to maintaining a log when it refers to organizing your workout sessions so as to keep upgrading your effectiveness, your mealtimes need to be organized around that. When you are wanting to build your muscle mass, choose lean meat whereas you 'd be consuming pasta's if you want to nourish a more triathlon adapted appearance.\n\n**Water**\n\nDespite our physical bodies exist from 60%, even the smallest percent fewer will result in you longing for it. So with that mentioned, it is essential that you get adequate water in to meet these demands, primarily before, during as well as after training when you are vulnerable to drop the most through perspiration.\n\n[Re-hydration](https://i.redd.it/pznt2w9ebmk11.jpg)\n\n**Small exercise breaks**\n\nConsidering that we are all earning a living we will have to treasure those small rests we have the opportunity to take (lunch) and make them into greater than they are by definitely not just relaxing on your bum and eating. Rather utilize the opportunity presented efficiently by means of doing small workouts before eating. Go up a flight of steps 5 times and after that eat to really feel you've deserved the food you've been waiting on OR stir up a sweat and thereupon the mood for food, which you failed to have earlier.\n\n**Go offline**\n\nBeing psychologically secure and positive will attribute a great deal to your outcomes of the workout session. As social media is a big (for most at least) element to your every day life's journey, it may be a good tip to \"Go offline\" by putting your mobile phone down an hour or two prior to your workout to get to a tranquil state and be completely concentrated on the workout you are wanting to carry out.\n\n[Rock Climbing](https://i.redd.it/5wvmm2cfbmk11.jpg)\n\n[**Doing new things**](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/excellent-day-to-day-training-trends)\n\nOther than a selection in the workouts you are carrying out, they may perhaps end up being a pain and because of that, try training anew by doing/trying out various kinds of activity that train the very same muscle groups. Think about recreations like kayaking, climbing, boxing and such.\n\n**Quit bad habits**\n\nMay seem easier to say than stop carry out, yet it ought to stated nevertheless. Behaviors like smoking, severe alcohol consumption, junk food stops belong to those.\n\n**Sleep well**\n\nAn additional routine of achieving/maintaining a healthy and balanced body is assuring you have adequate rest. [Exercising](https://lightleaf.store/collections/clearance-sale) on only 3 to 4 hrs of snooze time will definitely take you out fast. Pursue around 6-8 hrs and perform to the optimum.\n\n[**Work out regularly**](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/diversification-rules)\n\nA significant component of managing a healthy system and amongst our top tips is to work out routinely. As soon as you don't you may be overdoing your training session quickly as you do not have a genuine measurement device other than your emotion (not always the greatest measurement tool, feeling). Avoid pain of your muscular tissues over the long-term by completing routine workouts and follow your schedules.\n\n[Head Outdoors](https://i.redd.it/fovhb1bgbmk11.jpg)\n\n**Head outdoors**\n\n[Exercising](https://lightleaf.store/collections/clearance-sale) at the training center is great and all, still, head out and get a bit of sunshine (Vitamin D) every once in a while. It avoids your physical workouts from coming to be monotonous and a drag and will educate you much more regarding your immediate setting (hiking).\n\n**Keep your balance.**\n\nWhen you have an end goal in mind, typically folks go directly for it to guarantee its accomplished asap. Shaping your system and wellness usually requires a little bit of time. Never exaggerate it and see to it you work out equally to get a balanced outcome.\n\n[**Mentally stable**](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/international-day-of-yoga-2018)**.**\n\nHave lots of rest. Meditation, yoga and easy strolls are a wonderful series of physical exercises that aid tremendously in keeping you think straight. A full week full of workout sessions can quickly emerge as nerve-racking, combine this with a taxing career and your mug shall overflow. Include a yoga program of a several hours into your weekly activity and maintain your calmness and achieve/maintain the body you desire.\n\n[Yoga](https://i.redd.it/crwkfkqgbmk11.jpg)"

  "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI started going to the gym last week with no specific goal apart from forming a good habit to begin with. I am kind of “skinny fat”,  168cm, 62kg so I will probably want to get toned ultimately but for now, it’s more important to me that I keep doing it every day  no matter what. \n\nI cannot run properly as I broke my ankle (fibula) in the same spot 3 times and now I have metal plates in that place. They don’t hurt but I feel uncomfortable. Sooo my first question is this- instead of running, I do fast walking (6.5 mph) at an 15% incline. I do that for 20 minutes (plan is to add time every day until I reach 30mins). I am not feeling any pain in my legs- does this mean my walking has no effect? \n\nSame question for swimming- I used to swim “professionally” long time ago (I sucked but was doing it for years so at least, unlike with walking,  I am sure I got the technique right)- 30 mins of breast stroke and no signs of pain in my muscles. \n\nI am not an active person, 100% sedentary except walking dogs twice a day but that’s no workout, we live in a city.\n\nToday was my 3rd time at the gym, I imagined I would be in a lot of pain but nothing.. not that I am desperate to be in pain I am just worried that I am wasting my time and will end up having to get a personal trainer to show me how to do things properly. I would really like to avoid that. \n\nAny thoughts? Is 15% incline in any way “substituting” for the fact I am not actually running? Is there a way to make walking more intense? Maybe holding weights? Again, I don’t have a specific goal as of yet but I would not want to waste my time if my self determined “workouts” have no effect so just trying to get things right\n\nThank you! \n\n"

I mostly worked out at school during my weightlifting class which consisted of 45lb dumbbells and a few bars with plates. I managed to go from 130-135 range to about 140ish by the end of the year. I have a really hard time gaining weight. I’ve followed a diet, drank weight gainers, the whole sha-bang; it just won’t work. Fast forward to now, I’m a freshman in college and i’m 5’10 and I weigh 153 average. I have a decent build, I’m not super skinny, but I’m skinnier than I want to be. I have muscle definition and I have meat on my bones, but I honestly just feel so small and I feel as if I can’t really grow. I’ve been able to grow the amount of weight I throw around in the gym but I physically can’t seem to move pass the plateau and it’s disheartening. I feel less motivated to go to the gym and I break the habits of a diet because I feel like it doesn’t work. I honestly have no idea what to do. I’m not doing this for anyone else, I want this for me. "

  "text": "Hey guys, I’ve been working out for about a year now, but recently some questions have popped into my head. So I started working out when I was 15, and now I’m 16. When I first started working out I got help from my dad, but now I want to start doing different work outs to get bigger but I’m not sure how. I’ve made some progress from when I first started but now I feel like I haven’t moved up weight In months. I am currently doing 25 lb weights for chest workouts and bicep workouts. I don’t currently do back, because everytime I do back I don’t feel sore the next day for some reason, but I’d like to start. For triceps I use dumbbells ranging in weight from 15-30 depending on the workout. I normally try to get 10-15 reps maybe more with the 25 lb dumbbells. (Btw I have a pull down machine, dumbbells, and a bench, so I work with what I have). So here’s the questions:\n\nWhat are all the workouts I can do for each body part?\n\nHow many times should I work out a week?\n\nShould I work 1 body part a day?\n\nHow many sets and reps should I be doing?\n\nDo I have to diet? I am not fat and never have been, so I saw no reason to diet, but many fitness videos highly suggest it. I don’t see how it would help me because I don’t need to lose weight, but I just wanted to ask anyway, just to make sure. (I weight 125 lbs btw).\n\nHow do I get bigger??? I feel like I have barely made any improvements in the past year, and I haven’t gone up in weight for a while.\n\nHow do you know what weight to use?? If I’m getting 10-15 reps and sometimes more should I move up in weight or something?\n\nWhy don’t I feel workouts some weeks? One week I do a workout and the next week I do the same exact thing and I don’t feel it, and it doesn’t make any sense to me. It’s also very annoying because I then feel like I have to take a break for a week in order to feel the workouts again. (That’s what I’ve been doing lately)\n\nThanks in advance for all your help guys! I really appreciate it."

  "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeek 1: Full-body split\n\nWeek 2: Two-day split: Upper body/Lower body\n\nWeek 3: Three-day split: Push/Pull/Legs\n\nWeek 4: Four-day split: Full body\n\nWEEK 1: WHOLE IN ONE\n\nYou’ll begin the program with a full-body training split, meaning you’ll train all major bodyparts in each workout (as opposed to “splitting up” your training). Train three days this first week, performing just one exercise per bodypart in each session. It’s important that you have a day of rest between each workout to allow your body to recover; this makes training Monday, Wednesday and Friday—with Saturday and Sunday being rest days—a good approach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe exercises listed in Week 1 are a collection of basic moves that, while also used by advanced lifters, we feel are suitable for the beginner as well. Notice we’re not starting you off with only machine exercises; a handful of free-weight movements are present right off the bat. Reason being, these are the exercises you need to master for long-term gains in muscular size and strength, so you may as well start learning them now. Carefully read all exercise descriptions before attempting them yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Week 1 you’ll perform three sets of every exercise per workout, which over the course of the week adds up to nine sets total for each bodypart, a good starting volume for your purposes. With the exception of crunches for abs, you’ll do 8–12 reps per set. This rep scheme is widely considered ideal for achieving gains in muscle size (the scientific term is hypertrophy) and is commonly employed by amateur and pro bodybuilders alike.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotice in the workouts below that your first set calls for eight reps, your second set 10 reps and your third set 12. This is referred to in bodybuilding circles as a “reverse pyramid” (a standard pyramid goes from higher to lower reps), where you decrease the weight each set to complete the higher rep count. For example, if on your first set of lat pulldowns you used 140 pounds for eight reps, try using 120 or 130 pounds on set two and 100–120 pounds on set three.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWEEK 2: SPLIT DECISION\n\nYou’re only a week into the program, yet you’ll begin to train different bodyparts on different days with a two-day training split (meaning the entire body is trained over the course of two days, rather than one as in the first week). You’ll train a total of four days this week; the split includes two upper-body days (Monday and Thursday) and two lower-body days (Tuesday and Friday), and each bodypart is trained twice. Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday will be your recovery days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeveral exercises from Week 1 are carried over to Week 2, but one move is added to each bodypart routine—with the exception of abs—so you can train all muscle groups more completely from multiple angles. Chest, for example, includes two exercises: One is a compound movement (dumbbell bench press) that involves multiple joints (both the shoulder and elbow) to work the largest amount of muscle possible, and the other is an isolation exercise (dumbbell flye) that involves only one joint (shoulder) and targets the pecs to a greater extent. (When doing presses for chest, the deltoids and triceps are involved to a degree, meaning presses don’t isolate the pecs as much as flyes do.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou’ll again employ a reverse pyramid scheme of reps, though in Week 2 you’ll go slightly higher in reps (15) on your third set of each exercise. Fifteen reps may be just outside the ideal muscle-building range, but these sets will help you increase muscular endurance to provide a solid foundation on which to build size and strength going forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWEEK 3: THREE ON THREE\n\nIn the third week of the program we step it up to a three-day training split: Train all “pushing” bodyparts (chest, shoulders, triceps) on Day 1; hit the “pulling” bodyparts (back, biceps) and abs on Day 2; and work your lower body (quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves) on Day 3. As in Week 2, you train each bodypart twice a week, so you’ll hit the gym six days this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne new exercise is added to each bodypart routine to provide even more angles from which to train your target muscles to promote complete development. You’ll hit each muscle group with two exercises of 3­–4 sets each: four sets for large bodyparts (chest, back, shoulders, quads, hamstrings) and three sets for smaller bodyparts (biceps, triceps, abs, calves). The result is 16 total sets for the week for large bodyparts and 12 sets total for smaller ones—again, working in the 8–15-rep range—which is a substantial increase in volume from Week 1.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWEEK 4: TURNING UP THE VOLUME\n\nIn the fourth and final week of the program, you’ll train four days in a four-way split that hits each bodypart just once (except for calves and abs, which are each trained twice). Four-day splits are common among experienced lifters because they involve training fewer bodyparts (typically 2–3) per workout, which gives each muscle group ample attention and allows you to train with higher volume. As you’ll see, chest and triceps are paired up, as are back with biceps and quads with hamstrings, each a very common pairing among novice and advanced bodybuilders. Shoulders are trained more or less on their own, and you’ll alternate hitting calves and abs—which respond well to being trained multiple times per week—every other workout. No new exercises are introduced in Week 4 so that you can focus on intensity in your workouts instead of learning new movements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRep schemes remain in the hypertrophy range this week, but overall volume increases by adding more sets to individual exercises: up to five sets per move for larger bodyparts, and even 10 sets of calf raises on Thursday. This bump in volume will ensure that your muscles are overloaded sufficiently to continue the growth they’ve already begun experiencing in the first three weeks. Completion of this four-week program now entitles you to go to the next stage."

  "text": "The second you complete a [training session](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/12-routines-that-go-along-with-a-healthy-and-balanced-body), you fall under one of two camps: You're starved for something eatable, or you avoid it. However, people in the last group may want to reconsider their energy approach, as it could be undermining your weight management or fitness-related aims.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9zjx2c193en11.jpg\n\nThere are numerous explanations for bypassing meals right after a workout session. Several assume doing this will mess up the work they just invested, while other folks basically really don't believe they have the craving for it. Which makes good sense: Research presents that [physical exercise](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/diversification-rules)\\-- specifically lengthy or rigorous courses of it-- reduces the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin, and this can use up to 3 hours for your craving to go back to normal.\n\nHowever, if you do not eat QUICKLY, your cravings may thump you over the head when it comes back. And, prolonging the moment you eat decelerates your recuperation process, which in turn might inconvenience to give it your all the subsequent moment you hit the fitness center.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/77bcefgg3en11.jpg\n\nFortunately, all you actually have to do is grab a little recovery nibble, preferably inside of an hour of finishing your workout session. That's when your system is most responsive to muscle repair and glycogen resumption (the carb stores your body takes from for fast energy). It won't need to be a specially-formulated 600-calorie shake, either-- a little something as straightforward as yogurt and a banana, a piece of fruit and a chunk of cheese, or perhaps 8 ounces of delicious chocolate milk may be adequate to soothe. Provided that it consists of energy-restoring carbs and healthy protein you require to start the recuperation process, you're good.\n\nAnd so, next time you're contemplating about [post-recovery energy](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/smart-foods-before-working-out), make the caloric investment. It'll optimize your sweat time, bringing a more significant reward over time"

  "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/f6f8cgbm5po11.jpg\n\nBurning up body fat is one thing which's guaranteed by numerous [exercise programs](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/the-greatest-exercise-trends-of-2018) however they all come with a single thing alike; the system responsible for it.\n\nSo without further hubbub, let's have a glance at exactly how our physiques utilize body fat. Essentially, there are 3 key steps included when shedding body fat:\n\n\\- **Mobilization** \\- Fatty acids and glycerol are unleashed from triglycerides kept within fat cells.\n\n\\- **Transportation** \\- Fatty acids transfer into the circulatory system.\n\n\\- **Oxidation** \\- Essentially the \"burning off\" of fatty acids to generate energy.\n\n[Shed Body Fit](https://i.redd.it/d00sz76i5po11.png)\n\nWith respect to individuals who are presently lean, within the **12%-15% array**, mobilization and transportation is a huge issue. The decreased blood circulation to the area makes the tenacious body fat tougher to burn.\n\nFor individuals who are **15%-35% body fat**, mobilization and oxidation is going to be simpler. You could drop fat rather simply whenever you remain in a calorie shortage. Self-constraint and understanding health and nutrition typically is the issue here.\n\nWhen it comes to individuals who are **35% or more body fat**, mobilization is certainly not an issue because of a lot of fatty acids in the bloodstream. Oxidation is actually the trouble area here.\n\nHope this piece of science clarified just how your body functions shredding those extra pounds on various body types and weights. Within our following post our experts will be examining a \"**Fasted cardio and the works**\"."

  "text": "Dropping excess fat whilst maintaining or developing muscular tissue is actually tricky. Luckily, there are methods to drive your system to shed fat better as energy through a commonly named fasted cardio. Lots of fitness publications as well as blog posts refer to fasted cardio, yet they are skipping a huge aspect - fasted cardio is not actually the same as [cardio](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/bodies-are-made-to-move) on an unfilled belly.\n\n[Cardio](https://i.redd.it/h0o1dpt2bwo11.jpg)\n\nFasted vs Empty Stomach\n\nIf you want to thoroughly learn about what fasted cardio is, you should comprehend what takes place to our systems the moment we consume.\n\nWhen we eat anything, that food, our system commences the food digestion process. This implies breaking down that food into various compounds such as glucose, fatty acids, as well as amino acids.\n\nWhen we've done this, the small intestine will assimilate those nutrients right into the blood stream. This is exactly where insulin shows up.\n\nOur blood insulin spikes and transports these nutrients into our cells. These insulin degrees will continue to be increased depending upon the size and combination of the food you just ingested.\n\nFor every one of you science enthusiasts, once we've eaten, we are in a \"nourished\" or \"postprandial\" condition. The moment we are in this nourished condition, our blood insulin levels are greater than normal.\n\nWhen the body absorbs every little thing, your body will go into a \"fasted\" or \"postabsorptive\" condition. This is the moment our blood insulin values are at a standard level.\n\nSo, given that our bodies move in and out of these particular conditions each day, you find that even if your stomach seems empty, it may not suggest you find yourself in a fasted condition. Becoming healthy without burning up your gains is feasible without taking pills, and fasted exercise is the strategy."

I really like it and I tried to fix my schedule but it's very difficult to me to achive my goals. \nMy workout is a 3 days split routine. I have a \"home gym\" with a barbell, a bench, a pair of dumbbells and some plates. \nMy question is: It is good to do a short bodyweight routine every day in addition to the 3 days of training with weights? Like 3x20 push ups, 3x20 squats, 3x20 standing calf raises, 3x20 dips and 3x20 crunches.\nThanks"

  "text": "Hey guys,\nI was wondering if anyone here prefers or has seen better results from full body workouts, rather than targeting a specific muscle group.\n\nMy physical therapist told me that when you workout one muscle group, it releases muscle growth hormone throughout your blood.  He explained that focusing mostly on one muscle group, but also doing a few exercises for the rest of your body, can show better muscle growth results.\n\nAny thoughts?"

  "text": "A coin has 2 surfaces, and this particular principal moves a very long way and could be related to a wide variety of things in life. The exact goes with fasted cardio and in case it is your very first time reading about fasted cardio, it may well seem basic, yet there are a number of warnings. When you do not have your eating plan \"kind of\" dialed in, it matters not what form( s) of cardio or workout you do; you wouldn't step up fat loss.\n\nAs useful as fasted cardio is to pressuring your body system to employ body fat for energy, not taking in an excellent diet will burn up your muscular tissue quick. I would like to tackle the (couple of) factors which you ought to watch out for doing cardio when fasted before we delve into the (many) reasons that you should try fasted cardio.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/3524d2ik8ap11.jpg\n\n[**Fasted Cardio**](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/fasted-cardio-an-understanding-in-an-efficient-workout-concept) **is Catabolic**\n\nThe key cause fasted cardio has such a bad name results from the simple fact that it is remarkably catabolic.\n\n**Just what does catabolic indicate?**\n\nCatabolism is the breakdown of particles to create less complex ones. Anabolism is the construction of muscle (anabolics) as well as catabolism is the utilization of muscular tissue for energy.\n\nIngesting a well-rounded meal packed with naturally healthy foods, using supplements, and having lots of necessary protein into your diet regimen helps in reducing the catabolic impact of fasted cardio.\n\n**Just Why is** [**Fasted Cardio**](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/fasted-cardio-an-understanding-in-an-efficient-workout-concept) **Great For Fat Loss?**\n\nIn the end of the day, fat decrease needs a calorie shortfall. People have to comprehend just how much energy you are actually burning and you should understand what you are taking in.\n\nWhile a simple calculator can't take into effect certain aspects of your health that can affect your calorie expenditure, there are plenty of tools to help you get a decent idea.\n\n**How Exactly Does** [**Fasted Cardio**](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/fasted-cardio-an-understanding-in-an-efficient-workout-concept) **Work?**\n\nFasted cardio comes with a few exceptional perks above fed cardio considering that when you remain in a fasted condition, your system raises lipolysis and also fat oxidation levels. This is a complicated word which implies your system will begin utilizing fat stores for energy.\n\nLipolysis is the breaking down of fat cells for fuel, whilst fat oxidation is the melting of this energy.\n\nTherefore because our blood insulin values are at baseline, your body is much more ready to use body fat for energy."

I've joined a gym and I got some decent jogging shoes. If anyone could help me piece together a training plan I would really appreciate that. \n\nI am 5'9'' (175cm), 170 lbs(77kg) and in my mid 30's. I have not been working out a lot, but I am not totally new to a gym either. For a relatively untrained person I am somewhat strong, but my endurance and conditioning is just shit. I have a couple medical issues that will slightly limit my workouts. \n\nMy biggest problem related to working out is eczema. Days where my eczema is bad I can't really do cardio as sweating is a real problem and I will also need to take breaks between sets to keep heartrate down. As I can't predict when my eczema flares up I need to have a somewhat flexible workout plan(On average I'd say about 2-3 days of the week I will be unable to break a sweat).\n\nMy other problem is with my hands causing me to have limited grip strength / endurance(If I do assisted pullups the grip is the limiting factor, not back / arm muscles). This is a much smaller problem than the eczema, but something I need to keep in mind.\n\nI currently smoke about 10 - 15 a day, but will cut down a bit during these 6 weeks, my diet is also really crap mainly consisting of pizza, chocolate and snacks. I will try my best to eat more vegetables and lean meat while doing this, if you have any suggestions on what food I need to be eating I'm all ears though.\n\nMy gym is open 24/7 and I will spend as much time as needed there.\n\nAny tips / tricks to maximize the results of my little \"workout binge\" would be appreciated. Will check in on this thread often if you need some additional information."

It doesn't look like a lot of weight. It's got to be more than it looks, but it looks to me the same as I'm currently using, which is only 30lbs on the dumbbells (the guy apparently curling about 30lbs on the barbells looks ridiculous unless he's going reeeaaal slooow). \n\nI was just admiring these \"massive pythons\" of mine and realizing it's not much progress considering I've been working out religiously since about May.\n\nMy basic routine is 4 sets of dumbell curls (10 each arm), hammer curls, then barbell curls and wide barbell curls. \n\nLately, I've been going back and doing more reps of each after at a slightly reduced weight because it's easy to do and I was just hoping it would help. It seems to have helped because in the past month I was able to increase my barbell curls from 40 to 60lbs and my dumbbell curls from 20 to 30...but, honestly, I feel like maybe I could have increased the poundage a while ago. I was just trying to do it the \"right way\" by not overtraining and by not cheating by jerking my body around.\n\nAnd speaking of overtraining, that conundrum is exactly why I ask. After this amount of reps at 30lbs and 60 lbs for dumbbell and barbell respectively, I am shot. It definitely is my limit. So, I wonder how long it will be before I can lift more. And what I'm lifting right now is not making the big biceps. Yet, if I tried to lift more, (A) I couldn't, (B) I would probably break my wrists and elbows right off as the weights slammed into the floor."

My calves, in particular, are REALLY thin and I feel so self-conscious wearing shorts because my calves are unproportionally thin to the rest of my body. The sides are pretty much straight when you look at them from the front- almost no curvature from muscle.\nSo, how do I bulk them up? I tried calf raises for 15 minutes every other day for some months but nothing seemed to come out of it. I would do it more often but I'd be too sore. I read that you need to shock the muscle to make it grow because it's supposedly the hardest muscle to build. Should I focus on ellipticals, biking machines, etc? I just don't know how almost everyone has huge calves. How do you guys do it?"

I had been trying to stick to 3x12, 4x8 etc but found it tedious. \n\nI'm usually trying to be quick in the gym as I work and have to get home. I've started loosely following the 300 workout I found online although I've modified it. I basically do 50 reps spread over 3/4 sets per muscle group. \n\nLast night I did chest press w/db, barbell shoulder press, triceps and then biceps to finish. Today it was deadlift, pull downs, rows and leg raises.\n\nI'm pretty sore due to the intensity of getting through this in about 35-40 minutes. \n\nCan anyone suggest a way of improving this or if they have had similar success with a similar routine?"

The market peaked and retail stock has gone up as much as 33% when compared to 2015. So how does time affect the market and what changes do new retailers need to make to stay ahead?***\n\n**Just what did the price tag do given that brand-new participants begun?**\n\nAs we Light &amp; Leaf do business in activewear goods over 2 center items that are leggings and sports bras our team made a decision to smart screen our devices to concentrate on these mainly.\n\nWhile the marketplace for conventional sports apparel providers (think, non-patterned \"Basic\" sports apparel like yoga pants, and tops) stayed at a very similar price point and has not influenced the marketplace as much, indicating it's not at a moment of crucial motion.\n\nMeanwhile, freshly entered participants for activewear are actually a lot more evident, but not yet at the end station. These stores are still in the process in getting worry-free with their suppliers (manufacturers) in addition to their own clients who are presently coming to them for their activewear.\n\n[light &amp; leaf Fashion Activewear](https://i.redd.it/ajk7s4r6mnd11.jpg)\n\n**Activewear Trends: What is hot and what is not!?**\n\n**Geared up to take care of development?**\n\nThe major factor for numerous retailers to go into the marketplace which was blasting at it's level 2 years ago may well have truly peaked already. Nowadays the styles are being shifted out for plaid colored activewear or a retro-looking block print.\n\nThe intriguing aspect of this review is however that the change in general needs of customers is being matched rather swiftly by the non-traditional retailers through a 13% downturn in request as compared to the 4th quarter of 2015.\n\nIn comparison, conventional retailers are growing their stock by 29%.\n\nThose non-traditional sellers are a lot better put together to conform to a modification in the marketplace than conventional ones, as it has been their enterprise for such a long time and they are, economically established to ride the wave until the following one happens.\n\n**Best Selling Products?**\n\nFollowing our evaluation, we have confirmed that 3 specific product lines work tremendously well in the conventional and non-traditional providers;\n\n1 # A set of leggings, crop top and sports bra of which most sets are in neutral tones.\n\n2 # A sports bra with elements related to fashion that has mesh paneling, unusual straps and shapes.\n\n\\# 3. Cropped hoodies that can be combined with leggings are reaching a new level in the sales upcoming globally.\n\n\\#Secret 4th # Unisex wise, lightweight post-workout layers are increasing drastically over the year of 2018.\n\n**Now you know exactly what to focus on as a retailer and know what to expect from most shops. But, what about the future, what things are best to invest in and how can I get ahead of the boom of the next trend before it happens?

  "text": "A little bit of context to the situation; I injured my knee after taking a month break from running. I guess I ran a bit too enthusiastically and injured it in the process. It had been hurting for approximately two weeks, to date. I decided to go to the doctor two days ago, because I can not stay still (I need to remain active). They only did an x- ray (no broken bones) which should be the case. These past two weeks I have been applying ointments/patches, massaging it, using a band and I just took some Tylenol yesterday early afternoon(first time). Today after sleeping with an ice pack under my knee-pit propped by a pillow I woke up with no pain. Should I still go get an MRI done, as I hope to increase the intensity of my workouts if my knee continues to feel just fine?\n\n\\*Maybe someone has experienced something similar, as I am sure there are some runners here.

  "text": "So a few months ago, two people that are close to me approached me and requested to go to the gym with me to train. They were not sure as to what they doing in the gym when they were going by themselves initially. I told them that to see results they would need to be consistent. Besides being consistent, they should want to make this a lifestyle rather than just doing it for the sake of telling yourself “oh yes, I go to gym” for the sole reason of self satisfaction. I also explained to them the health benefits of staying active and how small changes in their diet can yield them big results if they stayed consistent and disciplined. Anyways, they started working out with me, I gave them time to make themselves comfortable even though they seem to have been going to the gym on and off for the past few years. I tried to reach them and explain them the workouts we would be doing that day but they for a majority of the time they seemed to have listened but not cared. Their intensity I thought was mostly low. They almost have no idea of what weight they should do even though they have been on and off at the gym for past couple years. Then eventually after 6-7 weeks they seem to have tapered off, not watching their diet, and coming to the gym again for the sake of coming to the gym. I told them I cannot train then anymore because they seemed uninterested and indisciplined and never wanted to learn or be better in the gym than their previous session they had in gym. I want them to do good, make healthy choices but still have fun. However at this point I have lost all the will and energy to help them/train them because of their lack of interest/ discipline. How do I approach this? These ppl are dear to me and I try to provide as many resource I can to help them get on track but they seem to not utilize the resource at all. I’m fed up and just feel I’m wasting my time. How do I go about this? I’m sorry if this was long and repetitive but any help will be appreciated!"

Producing at constrained quantities, incredibly high prices (you know what I mean) and frequently selling out. Stars, models, and \"community standing\" pressure of buyers have never ever played a more crucial function.**\n\nThis specific year, it is anticipated that there will be a rise in sellers who offer a loosening of silhouette on pre and post-workout layers and palettes aligning.\n\n**Market Opportunities**\n\nComing from the information that we have assessed so far, we have a crystal-clear outcome that we are working with a steady market place, a market which is certainly not on the breach of exploding. Nevertheless, there certainly is a decline to the ever-growing peak and as for we can view, there certainly are 2 golden keys which new and upcoming retailers should focus on:\n\n**1. Plus Size**\n\nRetail stores are finally identifying and adjusting to the fact that a substantial portion of women are above size 14, and for those good reasons are currently presenting new product lines particularly fo them. Plus-sized ladies likewise live active lifestyles and will certainly choose your brand name if it assisted them throughout their weight reduction through high-end clothing lines.\n\nFor individuals who have not yet recognized this, you 'd better do something about it to ride this plus size ripple before Amazon sweeps it clean.\n\n[light &amp; leaf Fashion Activewear Street Workout](https://i.redd.it/c9pfdrnt4se11.jpg)\n\n**2. Sustainable**\n\nRecognizing that there is a boost in sales of activewear, there is typically a portion of this community who intends to consume in a moral way. Approximately 60% of the supplied garments is produced from artificial fabrics, and activewear makes use of more manufactured fibers than found in every other category.\n\nThe concern is however that you need your activewear to be actually resilient and also have particular qualities that for example, \"odor control\", \"moisture wicking\" and \"body lifting\" so as for many to even think of buying these goods. Sadly, those goods will be meant for land fill functions by the end of it's usage and do not add to a lasting natural environment.\n\nThis specific however is changing due to H&amp;M's \"Conscious Collection Activewear\" line of product that makes use of recycled fibers. Enlightening the marketplace of the opportunity of activewear that does not leave behind your footprint on our precious planet.\n\n**Thank you for sticking with us through this lengthy article about activewear.

PT cleared me to start working every  body part except for my legs.

This is my plan and would like to get some opinions:  \n\n\n* Follow a diet of 2500 calories; 200g of protein( #ChickenFam) and around 50g of carbs.\n* Workout twice a day; once with weight lifting and the other is cardio or body weight exercises\n* 2 days of rest either taken together or divided during the week.\n* Will follow this until i get full capability and start doing soccer drills which will be about 3-4 month from now.  \n\n\nThank you in advance!   \n"

  "text": "This article covers some of the most common questions I receive about strengthening and building leg muscles such as: \n\n* What are the **best quad strengthening exercises**?\n* Will training legs accelerate fat loss?\n* How do I get tear drops quickly?\n* Should I be doing more squats or more deadlifts?\n* What is the *science behind effective quadriceps training*?\n* How can I strengthen my knee after injury or with some arthritis?\n\nLet's get started.\n\n### HOW TO BUILD STRONGER LEGS QUICKLY: INTRODUCTION\n\nWhy is it that we are able to devote hours on end in the gym chiseling our upper body, but every time leg day comes, everyone either has knee problems or they have to go get medicine for their dog?\n\nThis is the real talk people, if you want a chiseled, well-rounded physique, you have to give your legs as much (probably even more) attention as you give your chest and biceps!\n\nWhat is the single most ridiculously unappealing thing about a man’s body? I’ll give you a hint; it’s not the beer gut. It’s his chicken legs.\n\nIn the following, we are going to be talking about the science behind strengthening the biggest muscle in your leg, ***how to strengthen knee after injury***, and how to combine training methods of quad and hamstring training for maximum results.\n\nLet’s dig into everyone’s least favorite topic - leg training science.\n\n## THE ANATOMY OF THE QUADRICEPS MUSCLES\n\nAs your logical deduction might have led you to believe, the quadriceps muscle comprises of a group of individual muscles, these are:\n\n* Rectus Femoris\n* Vastus Lateralis\n* Vastus Medialis (which includes the coveted vastus medialis oblique, or VMO)\n* Vastus Intermedius\n\nInterestingly enough, there is a new research on the quadriceps suggesting that there might be a fifth muscle involved, so maybe this isn’t the correct term anymore.\n\nThe job of the quadriceps muscles is to hip flexion and knee extension. This means that the quads are responsible for bending the hip joint as well as straightening the knee joint.\n\nIn order to prevent knee injury and to have a strong, rigid body, you need to develop a big set of wheels.\n\nSo let’s move on to the science behind quad training.\n\n## SCIENCE OF EFFECTIVE QUADRICEPS TRAINING\n\nYour legs are a big muscle group. Quads are a big muscle group. Think of your hamstrings as your chest and quads as your back. Would you hit each and every muscle of your back with isolation exercises for god knows how many reps and sets? Probably not, because there isn’t enough time in this life to hit every muscle in the back.\n\nThe same goes for quadriceps.\n\nWhile you might hear and read various and more often than not, opposing opinions on how to effectively train the quads, the simple truth is the same as with any huge muscle group:\n\n* Compound movements build the most amount of strength and muscle\n* Back squats and front squats are the best exercises for quads\n* Assistance movements will be required for maximum development\n* Lifting heavy once a week for a specific compound movement is usually enough\n\n## QUAD TRAINING TYPES AND THE BEST QUADRICEPS EXERCISES\n\nWe are going to be looking at two types of quadriceps training:\n\n* Compound movements\n* Isolation/assistance exercises\n\nCompound movements will build muscle and CNS strength, and you will perform them in a low rep range, usually 4-6 for 5 sets.\n\nConversely, assistance work will serve as added time under tension and will add to the overall weekly volume spent training the muscle group. These will be performed in a moderate rep range, usually 8-12 reps for 3 sets.\n\nThese are also excellent ***quad strengthening exercises for runners*** and other performance athletes.\n\nRemember, volume and frequency are key in addition to progressive overload, so you will need to abide by the lawsof muscle and strength progression.\n\n### THE BARBELL BACK SQUAT\n\nThe king of all exercises, the back squat!\n\nUndoubtedly, one of the best mass and strength building exercises for your entire body, with emphasis on the quads, hamstrings, and glutes. Don't skip it.\n\nThere are two ways you can perform the back squat:\n\n* The High Bar Squat\n* The Low Bar Squat\n\nWhen performing the high bar squat you will place the barbell on top of your trapezius muscles and you will be able to keep a more upright stance.\n\nThis type of squatting is mostly used by Olympic weightlifters.\n\nSome quick tips for the high bar squat:\n\n1. Place the bar on top of the traps\n2. Grip the bar as narrow as you can and squeeze the lats\n3. Keep the chin neutral, chest flat\n4. Feet slightly more than hip-width apart, toes pointed out at 30°\n5. Take a deep belly breath at the top of the movement and hold until the next rep\n6. The bar must travel in a straight line\n\nOn the other hand, the low bar squat is the preferred technique for almost every powerlifter on the planet, simply because the low bar position will allow you to exert more force and you will most likely find that you are stronger using this technique.\n\n1. Place the bar on top of your rear deltoids\n2. Repeat all of the other steps from the high bar squat\n\n### THE BARBELL FRONT SQUAT\n\nOne of the best exercises in the world for emphasizing the quadriceps is definitely the front squat.\n\nThis exercise is perfumed the same way as the back squat, but this time you will place the bar on top of your front deltoid and you will be holding it with a crooked grip using two or more fingers.\n\nRepeat the steps for the back squat.\n\n### DUMBBELL AND BARBELL LUNGES\n\nContrary to popular belief, the lunge is not an isolation exercise, it is, in fact, one of the best compound leg exercises in the world. It will hit you quads, hamstrings, and glutes.\n\nMake sure to do these in the moderate rep ranges for maximum benefits and quad development.\n\nGrab a pair of dumbbells or put a barbell on your back, and start walking.\n\n### THE LEG PRESS\n\nThis is an exercise for mass and it’s all about steady contraction and overload.\n\nBecause it’s done on a machine, you are able to put a lot of weight and execute full range of motion. \n\n## A CASE FOR COMBINING QUADRICEPS AND HAMSTRING TRAINING\n\nAlthough the quads do make the majority of your leg muscles, in order to build strong and completely developed legs, you need to combine hamstring training as well.\n\nLuckily for you, this doesn’t mean spending a ton of time isolating the hamstrings as all of the exercises mentioned above are going to build the hamstrings and the glutes as well.\n\nRemember, the glutes are one of the most important muscle is your body, as they will determine the strength of your squat, deadlift and will greatly affect your bench press and overhead pressing movements!\n\nFinally, let’s mention ***how to strengthen knees after injury*** as well as some other final notes on quad injuries and recovery.\n\n## POSSIBLE QUAD INJURY AND HOW TO AVOID IT\n\nOne possible injury that could occur due to high stress and improper form is tearing in the quadriceps. Now, this can vary in severity from mild muscle tears that require a bit of stretching and foam rolling to complete muscle tears.\n\nAlthough you should know that quadriceps tears are very rare (the quads have a very high-stress limit), you should always remember to stretch, foam roll after a workout and execute proper form during lifts.\n\nThis will keep the quadriceps away from danger and will prolong your lifting career.\n\n### STRENGTHENING LEGS QUICKLY: SUMMARY\n\nQuad strengthening exercises are the cornerstone of every leg and lower body workout. Using these exercises and training strategies you can strengthen your legs, even with existing injuries and ailments that would otherwise hinder your progress. \n\nVisit Hustler Fitness to find more exercises instructed by  Daniel Burford.

  "text": "Looking healthier is something, however strength building and looking exceptional is an entire other level. Strength belongs to the aspects of training which just isn't specifically controlled to muscle size neither capability. Anyone could work out to gain muscle mass and from it, anyone will have the ability to burn fat (except if you intend to acquire it as muscle mass), run quicker, and hit harder.\n\n[Strength Building Strategies](https://i.redd.it/dpokgbducrh11.jpg)\n\nAre you all ready to develop strength and have all corporal activities in life end up being a bit lighter and simpler, have a glance at the strategies under to sort yourself out.\n\n**1. Secure the \"prime 4\"**\n\nAmongst the most effective strength-building exercises there are simply 4 unmistakable top dogs which are positively important. Squatting, deadlifting, bench pressing and shoulder pressing are these, definitely. Certainly, there are other types of lifts that may be deemed assistance lifts including the chin-up however aim primarily on the 4 strength building exercises pointed out above.\n\n**2. Gear Boss**\n\nDespite the fact that there is a great deal of gear to be chosen from in a training center (and most likely in your home too), the outright emperor of strength building equipment is the barbell, tightly shadowed by the dumbbell. START your training schedules with the barbell given that it is the first (and heaviest) step of strength building and you would certainly probably would like to have most power to perform your reps.\n\n[Barbell Lifting](https://i.redd.it/vl1c9b7idrh11.jpg)\n\n**3. Simplicity**\n\nThe minute you begin with your strength building workout routines, simplicity rocks! A number of your mentors may instruct you to perform a \"3 seconds up, 1 second down\" strategy, yet those are really for the advanced level mainly. When it concerns an amateur's strength building strategy, target using a speed to which you can stay and also getting it done in the proper way.\n\n**4. Keep a record**\n\nStrength building is about enhancing your former outputs, at your personal appropriate rate obviously. And so, keeping that in mind and running into the training center about 3 occasions a week (supposing that times permit) it would be effective to list your good results and conditions to make certain you are pressing that limit.\n\n**5. Do NOT overdo it!**\n\nWe've specified this various of times throughout the site but here it is once again; do NOT exaggerate your training EVER! Try to keep your workouts brief and capitalize on the hormonal rises (anabolic hormones) that aid accumulating muscle tissue. Everything that ought to primarily be incorporated in a 'decent workout routine' is 1 main lift activity, 2 assistance lifts and one core to reach the optimum from your strength building workouts.\n\n**6. 5**\n\nAn easy unwritten rule for the quantity of reps you are doing a certain activity for is 5. The majority of people beginning to building strength experience that right after 4th rep, they get overwhelmed and by the 5th they are pressing their limitations.\n\n**7. Little by little increase resistance**\n\nThe major justification of damage and plateauing (yes, it's a term) and end building strength is thanks to people's pride. Attempting to blow away those around you at the fitness center by utilizing weights which are excessively heavy or running unreasonably far for a duration too lengthy. Aim to step out of your pride for a bit and aim, without 2nd guessing, on your own system. Improve your game by 10% every time you want to raise the severity but never exceed a '10 pound' boost when it pertains to lifting.\n\n[Cardio Exercise - Running](https://i.redd.it/jmyo27ffdrh11.jpg)\n\n**8. Cardio (sucks)**\n\nCardio is also of strength building sadly. Developing into lean and healthy and building strength demands cycling and running, but likewise also triggers the catabolic hormones that cause muscle tissue breakdown. Due to this fact, make certain that your [cardio workouts ](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/bodies-are-made-to-move)are carried out in intense bursts and timed shortly. Sprint, run up a hill, do a 5 km cycle sprint and improve by doing more sprints, as opposed to longer ones.\n\n**9. Harmonizing your training sessions**\n\nTo develop a well-balanced, equally toned body through strength building its essential to work on it well-balanced. Do not miss leg day, and performing the workouts on the left side of your body as rigorous as you are utilizing your right side. That being stated, you won't be demanded to perform the left and right throughout the exact same session (even though it is favored), however it has to be performed in the same week to make certain the intended strength building outcome.\n\n**10.

  "text": "Looking stronger is one point, however strength building and looking exceptional is an entire other level. Strength is just one of the variables of developing which just isn't specifically restricted to muscle size not any capability. Anyone could work out to grow muscle mass and from it, anyone will have the ability to dropped weight (except if you strive to obtain it as muscle mass), run a lot faster, and hit harder.\n\n[Strength Building Strategies](https://i.redd.it/pl9asjurq0i11.jpg)\n\nAre you prepared to develop strength and have all corporal activities in life come to be a bit lighter and simpler, have a look at the [strategies](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/strength-building-strategies-that-you-should-know) here to sort yourself out?\n\n**Manage a Logbook**\n\nStrength building is everything about enhancing your earlier outcomes, at your personal appropriate rate obviously. And so, keeping that in mind and getting into the training center about 3 instances a week (when times permit) it would be excellent to document your outcomes and scenarios to make certain you are advancing that limit.\n\n**Do the** **\"prime 4\"**\n\nBetween the very best strength-building exercises there are actually 4 obvious champs which are definitely vital. Squatting, deadlifting, bench pressing and shoulder pressing are these, undeniably. Generally, there are many other lifts that may be deemed assistance lifts like the chin-up however concentrate primarily on the 4 strength building exercises pointed out above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Squat](https://i.redd.it/yrx0l94er0i11.jpg)\n\n**Tools Boss**\n\nThough there is a great deal of gear to be chosen from in a workout center (and most likely in your house also), the flat-out master of strength building equipment is the barbell, tightly shadowed by the barbell. START your exercise schedules with the barbell given that it is the first (and heaviest) step of strength building and you would certainly probably intend to have most power to carry out your reps.\n\n**Do NOT Overdo It!**\n\nWe've discussed this many of times across the site but here it is once more; do NOT overreach your training EVER! Try to keep your workouts brief and capitalize on the hormonal rises (anabolic hormones) that aid accumulating muscle tissue. What ought to primarily be incorporated in a 'decent workout routine' is 1 main lift activity, 2 assistance lifts and one core to reach the optimum from your strength building workouts.\n\n**Simplicity**\n\nWhenever you begin with your strength building [workout routines](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/diversification-rules), simplicity rocks! A number of your trainers may well advise you to perform a \"3 seconds up, 1 second down\" concept, yet those are really for the advanced level mainly. When it pertains to a rookie's strength building strategy, target using a pace to which you can stay and also getting it done in the proper way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[One More Rep](https://i.redd.it/d0wioqi8r0i11.jpg)\n\n**5**\n\nAn easy guideline for the quantity of reps you are doing a certain workout for is 5. Many people beginning to building strength experience that shortly after 4th rep, they get overwhelmed and by the 5th they are pressing their limitations.\n\n**Cardio (sucks)**\n\nCardio is also of strength building sadly. Developing into lean and healthy and building strength involves cycling and running, but on the contrary also triggers the catabolic hormones that are accountable for muscle tissue breakdown. For that reason, ascertain that your [cardio workouts](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/9-basic-workout-tips-getting-you-fit-for-beginners-pt-3) are carried out in intense bursts and timed shortly. Sprint, run up a hill, do a 5 km cycle sprint and improve by doing more sprints, rather than longer ones.\n\nBench Press: \n\n[Bench Press](https://i.redd.it/djee5531r0i11.gif)\n\nShoulder Press: \n\n[Shoulder Press](https://i.redd.it/osh30fb2r0i11.gif)\n\n**Doing It Right (quick recap)**\n\nSimply to make sure that you accurately understand that you are making it happen properly when it pertains to the 4 vital strength building exercises, here's a quick summary.\n\nSquat: Push your hips backwards as far as you can. Keep your lower back arched and after bending your hips, bend the knees (sounds familiar?) and squat low.\n\n**Slowly and Gradually Increase Resistance**\n\nThe primary justification of damage and plateauing (yes, it's a term) and end building strength is due to people's pride. Attempting to blow away those around you at the fitness center by utilizing weights which are excessively heavy or running unreasonably far for a duration too lengthy. Aim to step far away from your vanity for a bit and target, without 2nd guessing, on your own system. Improve your game by 10% every time you want to raise the magnitude but do not exceed a '10 pound' boost when it involves lifting.\n\nDeadlift: Place your legs narrow and stand as if you would jump. While bending down, grab the bar, back straight, hips down and shoulders right over the knees.\n\n**Harmonizing your Training Sessions**\n\nTo develop a well-balanced, consistently toned body via strength building its essential to work on it well-balanced. Do not miss leg day, and performing the workouts on the left side of your body as rigorous as you are utilizing your right side. That being mentioned, you aren't going to be demanded to perform the left and right throughout the very same session (even though it is favored), however it has to be carried out in the same week to make certain the intended strength building outcome.\n\nThese in particular were our primary suggestions on strength building strategies.

  "text": " \n\n## WHAT ARE STATIC STRETCHES?\n\nStatic stretches involve holding a muscle in a stretched and challenging (but comfortable), position for a short period of time, normally 10 to 30 seconds. \n\nStatic stretches are an acceptable and safe way of enhancing all-round flexibility and reducing DOMS and soreness after training sessions. It's generally universally accepted that stretches are best-performed post-activity or after a good workout program because it has been found to reduce performance if done before physical activity.\n\nFor improving range of movement for functional movement, however, dynamic stretches pre-workout are considered more beneficial. While both stretches have their pros and cons, today we'll talk about post workout stretches.\n\n## THE BENEFITS OF STATIC STRETCHING FOR MEN AND WOMEN\n\nSpending a few minutes after a tough session in the gym to perform static stretches (never mind the occasional ridiculous pose) could prevent injury and do your body a whole lot of good. Static stretches help improve flexibility, enhance your range of motions, relieve stress and lessen the risk of injuries.   \n\n\nResearchers have found solid evidence that static stretches offer therapeutic benefits when performed post-workout. \n\nThese are the top benefits of static stretching.\n\n### BENEFIT 1: ENHANCED FLEXIBILITY\n\nOne of the key benefits of stretching is improved flexibility of the various muscle groups in the body. While it’s important for fitness, flexibility also helps to reduce muscular tension. It helps stiff and contracted muscles to relax into their original forms. Regularly performing static stretches after a workout will make your body more flexible in no time.\n\nBending, squatting, and other flexibility related motions become a lot easier. Working your muscles hard and then stretching them properly helps the muscles adapt to a greater range of motion and makes it possible to optimally use their capacity the next time.\n\n### BENEFIT 2: ELIMINATES LACTIC ACID\n\nOnce you begin a workout, your body produces lactic acids which cause muscle fatigue and soreness. Performing proper static stretches will relax the muscles and get rid of the lactic acids.\n\n### BENEFIT 3: PREVENTS CRAMPING\n\nExcessive sweating and dehydration while exercising can cause painful muscular cramps. But this is hardly an excuse to skip leg day. Constantly rehydrating with sips of water and stretching those sore muscles will ensure their chancing of cramping up on you are greatly reduced.\n\n### BENEFIT 4: PROMOTES MUSCULAR COORDINATION \n\nStatic stretches improve the ability of the muscles to work in tandem. Consistent stretching makes this possible, and the resultant benefit is better functional mobility of the body’s muscle groups especially if functional strength training is your thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStatic stretches after intense weight training session greatly reduce muscle fatigue and tenderness by speeding recovery time. This gets your muscles fired up and thirsting for the next session.\n\n### BENEFIT 5: COOLS THE BODY DOWN GRADUALLY\n\nStatic stretching decreases muscle tension and increases muscle relaxation making it an ideal as a cool-down activity. Also, gentle stretching slows your racing heart at a gradual pace which puts less stress on your heart.\n\nYour body goes back to normal better when you perform cooldown stretches.  \n\n\n## THE BEST STATIC STRETCHES\n\nWhile there are as many types of static stretches as there are muscles groups in the human body, here is a list of essential stretches to cover a wide range of muscle groups and are considered to be most beneficial by sport medicine experts.   \n\n\n### STANDING QUADRICEPS STRETCH\n\nThe quadriceps are large muscles located at the front of your thighs. Asides from looking good on you, they help to move your upper leg, extend your knee and flex your hip. A tight quad can misalign your hips and put excess stress on your hamstrings. \n\n* Stand straight with one hand placed on a wall for balance. \n* Lift your right foot backward and hold it in place behind you with your right hand - your right heel should be touching your right butt cheek.\n* Pull the foot up towards your glutes while keeping the knee aligned with your hip.\n* Hold this position for about 30 seconds and repeat same on the other side.\n\n### SEATED FORWARD BEND\n\nThe hamstrings are large muscles located on the back of the thighs and extend into your glutes. It causes pulling and pain in your glutes when tight. All three areas can be stretched with the seated forward bend.\n\n* Sit uprightly on the floor with your legs stretched out in front of you. \n* Bend at the hips and lower your torso gently toward your thighs.  \n* Grab your feet, ankles or shin, depending on your flexibility\n* Gently pull yourself towards your thighs and hold for 30 seconds.\n\n### COBRA POSE\n\nThis static stretch routine works your abdominals, chest, shoulders and back at once.\n\n* Lie flat on your stomach on the floor with your legs stretched out behind you.\n* Place your hands under your shoulder with your elbows close to your body.\n* Lift your head toward the ceiling as you straighten your arms while pressing your hands, pelvis, thighs, and feet into the floor.\n* Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds\n\n### POST-WORKOUT CHEST STRETCH\n\nBunched up chest muscles can cause a hunched posture. The standing chest stretch can assist to loosen and lengthen your pecs. \n\n* Stand with your feet hip-width apart and align your shoulders, hips, and ankles.\n* Clasp your hands behind your back and slowly lift your arms until you feel the tension throughout your shoulders and chest.\n* Hold the position for about 30 seconds\n\n### POST-WORKOUT SHOULDER JOINT STRETCH\n\nYour shoulders could also benefit from static stretches. The shoulder handles a wide range of motions and involves the humerus, rib cage, clavicle, thoracic region, and scapula.\n\nThese complex interactions utilize lots of ligaments and muscles for stability. These muscles and ligaments are therefore prone to stiffness and injury\n\n* Hold out a towel in front of you with both hands\n* Slowly raise your arms straight above your head and behind you.\n* Hold this position for 30 seconds whilst ensuring the towel is held tightly\n\n### POST-WORKOUT LAT STRETCH\n\nYour lats or latimissimus dorsi are the powerful muscles that pull your arms closer to your body in exercises like pull up. When they become too tight, they could cause a slouching posture. Loosen up and relax your lats with this simple stretch.\n\n* Put one arm behind your head \n* Raise and place the other arm on top of your elbow and gently pull back while stretching your triceps, \n* Hold the stretch for about 30 seconds\n\n### POST-WORKOUT GROIN STRETCH\n\nThis stretches the groin, inner thighs, glutes, hamstrings and lower back. The groin muscles are some of the biggest muscle groups and function primarily to move the legs. However, they are quite prone to injury.\n\nSo, a little post-workout static stretch routine will help keep them limber and prevent injuries.\n\n* Sit on the floor\n* Bend your knees and firmly bring your feet together\n* Rest your elbows on your knees while holding your feet in your hands\n* Gently press down your knees towards the floor with your elbows while keeping your back straight.\n* Hold this position for about 30 seconds \n\n### POST-WORKOUT CALVES STRETCHES\n\nIt’s easy to ignore smaller muscle groups. But your calves deserve some love too because they play a major role in leg movement. Tightness in the calves could cause pain and imbalance.\n\n* Get into a seating position on the floor.\n* Stretch out your right leg and bend your left leg at the knees, so the left foot is resting on the inside of the right leg.\n* Reach for your right foot with your right hand while bending from the hip and pull it gently towards you. \n* Maintain this pose for about 30 seconds\n* Repeat on the other side.\n\n### POST-WORKOUT HIP FLEXORS STRETCH\n\nYour hip flexors are a muscle group at the top of your thighs that are responsible for moving your lower body. They make it possible for you to walk, kick, bend, and swivel your hips.\n\nStatic stretches will keep the hip flexors flexible and prevent tightness which can lead to a hip flexor strain.\n\n* Assume a kneeling position on the floor\n* Take a large step forward with your right leg so that you are in a lunge position.\n* With your upper body upright, push your hips forward till you feel a stretch on the front of your trailing leg.\n* Stay in that position for 20 to 30 seconds.\n* Repeat with your left leg forward.\n\n### POST-WORKOUT GLUTES STRETCH\n\nGetting the perfect set of butts seems to be all the rage these days. But with all the lunges, squats, hip thrusts, and step-ups, you need to show your glutes some love- they are about the biggest muscle groups in your body after all.\n\nStatic stretches targeting the glutes will improve flexibility and loosen any tension or tightness in the glutes and hips.\n\n* Stand with  both feet shoulder-width apart on  the floor\n* Raise your right leg and rest the ankle on your left knee.\n* Press down on your right knee with your right elbow while bending your left knee in a single leg squat.\n* Hold the pose for about 30 seconds.\n* Repeat with the other leg\n\nThis list is not exhaustive. But getting started on these basics will go a long way to maximize your workout and enable you to attain your fitness goals faster, including building muscle, losing fat and getting abs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a general safety guideline, static stretches should never be painful. If a technique causes you pain, reduce the range and build up gradually. Stretch only to the point where you are comfortable holding that position for 30 seconds. \n\nYou should hold each stretch for a minimum of 15 to 20 seconds for 1 to 2 rounds. As your flexibility improves, you can hold the stretches for longer durations for better results. Make sure to stretch each side equally.\n\nAlways breathe throughout each technique. Breathing helps to relax your body and helps deepen the stretch.\n\n#### SHOULD I STRETCH AFTER WORKING OUT?\n\nIf you want to stay injury-free, limber and flexible, post-workout stretches are the way to go. What stops many people from static stretching properly after work out is the belief they don’t have enough time. But what they really need for a proper cool-down post-workout stretch is only 10 minutes.  \n\n\nStretching consistently and regularly helps improve flexibility, increases the range of motion and reduces the risk of injury caused by abrasions of the connective tissue. In addition, stretching is great stress relief and helps improve mindfulness and mind-body connection. \n\nFor guys following my Shredded workout program, I strongly advise taking the time to stretch after your workout.\n\nSo after your next workout, don’t be in a hurry to head home to shower. Take a couple minutes to stretch, flush out the flush out the lactic acid and this will help avoid injury and cramps and help you maximize your next training session.\n\nVisit Hustler Fitness to learn other workout techniques!"

  "text": "So I actually started orange theory ( which is a HITT workout ) about 3 months ago, but went very inconsistently, also missed about 3 weeks up until a month ago. The last four weeks I have been going consistently anywhere from 4-6 times a week. \n\nI was a competitive cheerleader for over 18 years so my muscle memory is great, and I gain muscle and get fit pretty quickly. I am a 30 year old female and I have a naturally athletic body type, have a very strong core but have always fought belly fat. \n\nSo when I started back regularly a month ago my weight would range between 117–119. Over the last 4 weeks my weight has skyrocketed and I am ranging from 124-127. \n\nMy diet prior was very bad. I wouldn’t only eat 1-2 times a day, skip breakfast and eat processed foods and fast food all of the time. I have started concentrating on my diet, and stay below 1400 calories a day. \n\nI average about 19 splat points a workout. As for the treadmill because of my asthma I prefer pushing myself for shorter distances. My push I am typically running at a 7.7 at an 8 incline. \n\nI also have started going through a divorce about 4 months ago, so of course stress has been pretty high. ( going through this I do enjoy a couple of glasses a wine 3-4 times a week ) . I just started concentrating on my water intake again. But I feel very bloated and I can’t fit into any of my shorts or pants at the moment. I am just wondering with the stress and increased workout routine if my cortisol levels could be really high ? ( and if that’s the case what can I do about it ?) I am so frustrated and instead of feeling healthier and happier I just feel fat. \n\nI guess I am looking for help, insight or maybe just encouragement. But I am beyond frustrated.

  "text": "This post became longer than I intended to. You can skip the back story portion of this to give quick feedback on my programming questions. Sorry if my writing is all over the place, I wasn't the best in grammar and literature haha. \n\n\n\n\n-backstory-\n2 years ago I decided to finally make the plunge in the fitness world. I was a little guy, 5'3 135lbs, and with no real fitness history I was really week. I went full on developing strength. I wasn't the most consistent but I was seeing results slowly but surely. Benching was really feeling smooth and I felt like I had a good grasp of my form, even though form always needs to be worked on. Then there's squats and deadlifts. I was ignorant and stubborn when it came to these lifts. Everybody at the gym was lifting these really heavy lifts and to be honest, I was quite intimidated. So I tried to work up quickly in these and not listen to by body. I was pounding my body with not the greatest form. My lower back started to feel tight and I got really scared so I just stopped going to gym altogether, I was really down on myself.\n\nI think my personal best on the lifts is 155 bench, 220 deadlift, and 190 squat.\n\n-present time-\n\nSo now 2 years later I am ready to put my fears behind and really give it my all while taking care of my body.\nI like how this split has days dedicated to taking care of my body and conditioning.\n\nSmall guy 2 years ago has now turned into very slightly pudgy 5'3 155lb. \n\nSo my question for advice would be like this.\nI want to work up my basic strength to get back into the big compound lifts while trying to perfect my form in all lifts.\nCurrently my push up strengh is lacking and pull up strengh is non-existent. My legs, core, and etc will also need a lot of love.\n\n-Programming my workout-\n\nI want to focus on keeping my body healthy and not just big and strong. I did 5/3/1 for a little bit before and I really enjoyed plugging in my numbers on some sites and it does the math for me and it's nice progression I can easily track.\n\nJim Wendler's Beyond 5/3/1 has a program split that's like this.\nMonday - Upper body\nTuesday - Flexibility/Moblility\nWednesday - Conditioning\nThursday - Lower body\nFriday - Flexibility/Mobility\nSaturday - Conditioning\n\nI need help programming assistance workouts targeting all my important body parts in the lower body/upper body split while ideas for my condition and flexibility/mobility workouts.\n\nSo my first main goals would go like this.\n1. Flexibility/mobility - for getting my body back on track to being healthy and ready for anything I'll throw at it.\n2.

High-Intensity Interval Training**\n\n[High-intensity interval training](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/7-advantages-of-actual-high-intensity-interval-training-hiit) (also known as [**HIIT**](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/7-advantages-of-actual-high-intensity-interval-training-hiit)). A HIIT exercise workout entails bursts of maximum-effort, incredibly challenging (generally around 20 to 90 secs), tailed by a phase of low-intensity recuperation. The aim is to bounce back adequate that individuals could hit hard once again throughout your subsequent work interval. In case you're a novice, you may perhaps have extended relax periods, or work intervals which are actually strenuous however not actually at highest effort.\n\nHIIT workout sessions are generally 30 mins or less, though they could be even longer. Still, while they could be quick, they absolutely aren't going to be delightful. As the name reveals, HIIT training sessions are fashioned to be high intensity, and a huge part of the allure is that they are really an astonishingly efficient and effective approach to get your cardio running and lose loads of calories (for people seeking to accomplish that) without calling for a bunch of time.\n\nThat said, considering that they're so rigorous, you probably shouldn't be doing HIIT workout sessions daily. This could bring about overtraining and an increased likelihood of trauma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[HIIT Workout Tips](https://i.redd.it/ombj6binr0j11.jpg)\n\n**2. Group Training**\n\nGroup training (or team fitness classes) failed to make the top 20 crazes till 2017, yet their worldwide popularity is swiftly increasing. Our interpretation of group training is, as a training session for 5 or more folks led by a coach, created to be inspirational and effective for folks of varying health and fitness stages. This might be just about anything from trendy HIIT courses like, to dance cardio courses, to traditional step lessons at the fitness center.\n\nRegardless of what you want, there are lots of perks of group workout courses. They are a fantastic approach to try out a new physical workout or jumble your routine (do not forget that plenty of group training sessions give a complimentary initial lesson). There's additionally a social component-- lessons may be an interesting way to get your sweat on with good friends or come across new people.

I am currently 160 lbs and 5”11’ with a ectomorph body structure. I used to workout every day when I was a jounior and sophomore in high school. I stopped working out as much when I was a senior, because I had some personal issues. I’ve started working out again in my home, with 15, 25 pound dumbbells.

I didn’t work them out before because I was stupid and only thought the chest mattered. My main question is if someone could give me a workout plan to get back into shape; so I can start training for mass. I understand that some plans are 3 months long in order to change from fitness to mass building.

I know all about supplements taking protein and amino acids. I would like to gain some muscle weight and lose what few body fat pounds i have left. (i know cardio burns some muscle but i prefer to do it anyways). I am unfamiliar also how i repay any helps other than giving you karma so anyways I can give back i would be happy to do.

  "text": "First off I'd like to say I'm not really overweight. I weigh about 150 now, but about 185 previous to that. I lost the weight just by eating better pretty much. Although I look skinny, at least that's what people tell me, I still have \"love handles\" and a layer of fat on my stomach which is more prominent towards the bottom of my abs. I can slightly see the muscle definition showing through, but only towards the top just below my chest. My overall goal is to try to build a little muscle and tone up. Mainly my biceps/pectorals/abs. Does anyone have any tips on what I could to to achieve this goal and lose weight to build muscle overall? I'm personally fine at 150, I think that's a good weight for somebody my height(5'11\"-6'), however I'd like it to be muscle weight and not fat. Any advice on the workout or even eating habits I should know I would be very grateful. I am a 20yo male by the way."

  "text": "Hi so I’ve been working out for about 1 and 1/2 months now (Yay) and I’ve got some questions about my routine. Before I begin let me go into some background detail \n\nGender: Male\nAge: 15 (16 in a month)\nWeight: 148 lbs\nHeight: 6’0”\nBody shape: Kinda skinny with strong muscular legs\n\nSo I’ve been going to the gym for 3 days a week (Mon, Wed, Fri) now for the last month and a half and I’ve only been doing bicep/tricep (I know I know I don’t hate lol). But now I talked to a trainer for a bit and had a private session and I learned some good exercises for other muscle parts as well. So this is what I want my new routine to be and I had some questions about it. \nMon- Back/Bicep, Chest/tricep, shoulders\nTues- Legs and Abs\nWed-  Back/Bicep, Chest/tricep, shoulders\nThurs- Legs and Abs \nFri- Back/Bicep, Chest/tricep, shoulders\nSat- Run\nSun- Rest\n\nGoals: To bulk up and get a lean body, for the purpose of getting stronger too, but mainly to gain muscle mass and look good and show off(haha) also to develop decent abs.\n\nWhat I’m wondering about this routine is, is it okay or good for me to do all that stuff on mon wed and fri? I understand that back also works out biceps, and same with chest and triceps, which is what I was going for, but would it affect me negatively in anyway if I were to do all those muscle groups in one day? The trainer I talked to does this, but I wanted to get a couple (or more) opinions on this. So is this an okay schedule for me? Really appreciate the help and thanks!"

Within 10 minutes of consumption it had laxative effects (lol), and my stomach was in knots, I had indigestion, felt nauseous, stomach was gurgling etc. etc. Whilst I know caffeine intolerance may be the causation behind this, I doubt it because I had been previously drinking monster energy drinks and coffee on the regular and I was OK.

I mean like within a month type quickly, it's probably not realistic but... Here's my concern. Everyone seems to have conflicting opinions about whether you should plunge yourself into calorie defecits or spot ab training. Now I honestly have no idea which one to use... But given the circumstances I have leant towards spot ab training. Hear me out calorie defecit believers! My stomach fat is really small. Its like a very small muffin. Now as for calorie defecits, I barely eat as it is. I won't go into why but often I go from waking up to about 3.30pm in the afternoon without no food. So my first meal of the day is hours away from dinner. That's not always the case but it happens from time to time. On the days when I don't do this I still eat a smaller amount then I probably should. So if the body did eat away at the fat stored on your body wouldn't my stomach be flat,Ike completely flat by now. And no it doesn't eat fat from other places on my body. I am not anorexic and I don't look undernourished. In fact you can barely see my muffin fat through my shirt. I calculated my BMI and it was 18%. Apparently you need 12% to see your 6 pack, which after further calculation I discovered I need to lose 4kg. But I've been warned that I might burn muscle instead of fat. So I've resorted to doing a minimum of the following: 20 crunches, 20 mountain climbs, 20 bicycle crunches, 20 leg planks (someone told me to do 2 minutes but I find the impossible) and 3+ minutes of Russian Twists. I usually listen to music whilst doing them and get carried away and don't even realise I go generously over 3 minutes sometimes. Anyway, so I despite everything I just said I am an amateur and am new to the world of working out and stuff. So please, be kind in the comments, not pompous.

News Flash, it doesn’t.\n\nWhat are the specific exercises that you do during your workout that really hit your muscles hard? Try this for your next workout, instead of doing 5-6 different exercises for each muscle, do 3 exercises that you think hit your muscles the hardest and do more sets. Do 7 sets of 10 for each of those workouts. Focus more on the exercises that work for you instead of only doing them 4-5 times a workout, then wasting time on a workout that is not very effective for you.\n\nMore sets on key workouts will help you build more muscle and have an effective workout!

I dont have  a perfect physical body, but Im no fatso or stringbean either. If anything I'm on the chubby side.\n \nSo my question is, should i use protein powder? I dont understand exactly why its needed because in our afterschool powerlifting, I see these tall fat guys eating anout a spoonful 5 to 10 minutes before the workout. I assumed the fat on your body would be turned unto muscle/lost so i dont understand why protein powder is used?\n\nExplanations greatly appreciated."

The friend is a girl whom I've liked for a while now and during the party, at one point we are supposed to go swimming. And I'm kinda nervous to take off my shirt in front of her because I kinda let go of myself lately, not having much time to go to the gym anymore. I'm not overweight or anything at all, I'd say I'm \"skinny-fat\", so my body looks like I'm sorta built but skinny with clothes, but when I take off my shirt I have a bit of belly fat and the pecs I've worked out have now started to gain a bit of fat but not too much, you can still tell it's muscle but I'm just sorta worried. How can I sort of tighten up my body a little over these 5 days? It doesn't matter if it's temporary, I just want to look alright at her party and then later on once I have time, I'll start heading to the gym again to keep my body in shape permanently. But yeah, does anyone know how I can do a sort of trick where my body can tighten up the fat so I look less fat and more muscular in 5 days? Like a workout schedule/plan? Or body trick or something?

  "text": "Note, I'm asking for advice but can't find an advice subreddit specifically for work out stuff. If there is one let me know and I'll take this down and post it there. \n\nHello I am a 19 year old, 5 foot 1, 105 lb female. I'm relatively in shape, staying within my calorie balance, walking about 2 to 3 miles a day just by Meandering around school and work, and I work out when I can. I've already lost about 40 pounds since coming to college. And from then on I put on a decent bit of muscle. But for the life of me I cannot get good at Cardio. Over the summer between freshman and sophomore year I ran almost every single day, just trying to make a mile in one go. It took about two and a half months for me to be able to run the mile without having to stop or walk for part of it. Even then I was clocking in about 11 or 12 minutes. Now, I'm not looking to be Usain Bolt here, but I would like to be able to have good enough heart that I can run for 2 or 3 miles. \nI know you're just supposed to push yourself as hard as you can go, but I really am. For example today I hadn't done cardio in quite some time, but decided I was finally going to get back on the track today. I was just going to try and run as much of a mile as I could. I ended up doing about .2 miles just walking and warming up. Then I went to go jog at a relatively slow pace, but could only do .4 before I was panting and gasping. So I decided to slow down for one lap and then pick up the pace again the next one. I regain my breath and just like 30 seconds, but the second I started running again it was ripped from me faster than before. My boyfriend keeps saying I just need to push through it and not care about the fact that I'm literally panting and probably everyone in the gym can hear me, so I did and I just kept going. But then I started seeing little black spots in my vision and figured that probably wasn't the best. So I slowed back down to walk. I kept going back and forth between running and walking for the rest of the mile, I would recover very quickly, but as soon as I would start running again black spots would emerge and I would be panting again. \nIs there a chance I have like asthma or something? It's never come up before and I used to be in cross-country high school. Or am I just really really out of shape and didn't know it? Is there something I can do that I can push myself harder without have to worry about passing out running in the gym?"

  "text": "It didn't start popping until I had been working out for 9 months and kept increasing weight (as one does). 3 weeks ago, the right shoulder started popping, so I Googled it and found some guys on weightlifting forums saying it's just probably a ligament that has to stretch over more muscle mass now and hasn't stretched out yet. This seemed unlikely since I don't have giant shoulders. \n\nI kept Googling and saw one exercise should be avoided to prevent shoulder injuries. So, I stopped doing that one and I figured all was going to be fine.\n\nLast week, my shoulder was popping like crazy doing Arnold Presses, which was perfectly safe when I checked earlier, but I stop  mid-workout and Google up \"arnold press shoulder popping\" to see what could be the problem. I see that my form might be slightly wrong, so I adjust that. I adjust my form and it stops popping, so I figure that problem is now solved, too.\n\nI move on to the shoulder press and my shoulder is popping again. So, I find [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw3r2lytys8) and adjust my form. After I adjust my form, the shoulder stops popping, but I have to use less weight because now the weight is more awkward to lift.\n\nSo, I thought I fixed the problem, but for the past week, my shoulder pops when I do random things like pulling up the blankets in bed and this morning doing pushups.\n\nIt doesn't feel like it's popping out of joint, but it feels a little weird. I can move my arm up and get it to kind of grind/crunch pretty easily (so I avoid doing that)... but what's going on? Do I have to rest and lose all the progress I made over the last 9 months?\n\nI'm guessing there's some kind of inflammation from the shoulder rubbing the wrong way. It's strange that it's just one shoulder. The other shoulder I can move all the same ways and there's no grinding, crunching or popping noise at all."

I'm thinking because I sit at a desk and use a mouse all day, which causes forearm muscle shortening as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT-1mQSE3lw).\n\nFor the last week, I put the flexbar away and just did the stretching exercise for forearm shortening described in that second video. It did not work so great. I just picked up the flexbar again today and the pain really went away much more and faster.\n\nSo... doesn't seem to be \"forearm muscle shortening,\" I guess. The guy in that second video was so convincing and made it sound like such a common problem, I loved the idea that a simple stretch a couple times a day would get rid of it. But, it's not that.\n\nApparently, it's Golfer's Elbow...which is why the flexbar routine from the first video works.\n\nAnd I know it came from working out because the pain gradually increased since I started working out last May. I believe it began from curling weight that was possibly too heavy as well as upright rows that were possibly too heavy, but I stopped doing upright rows completely and brought the weight down on my curls over a month ago and started doing really slow reps instead. The pain is still there. I just did some curls with 15lb dumbbells (super easy) and that right forearm hurt with each rep.\n\nIs this tendonitis? Do I have to quit working out? The guy in that second video made it sound SO COMMON that I don't want to believe I have to quit working out just to heal my tendon, but I don't want to keep making this [apparently] Golfer's Elbow even worse.\n\n---\n\nE: answering my own question with this guy's tips for future reference: https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=5451243\n\n&gt; here is how i recovered 100%....\n\n&gt; taking the month off of lifting was key to the healing. all of my muscles needed time to recover, especially my tendons (all of them). i started doing negative bicep exercises (if you dont know what negatives are, google it.) i stayed very light still on the weight of curls. i iced my tendonitis everyday, twice a day. this was the BIGGEST thing in recovery. tendonitis is inflammation, icing it calms the inflamed tendons. i started taking Glucosamine/Chondroitin twice a day. i started eating lots of fruits, vegetables, and nuts. getting nutrients from these foods was essential i believe. i took fish oil 3 times a day. i was patient. every time i was lifting bicep/back i wanted to push my limits and see if i could get my weight up faster but i had to resist this. i curled 15lb dumbbells in the gym for weeks (and it was very embarassing for a guy who shoulder presses 90lb dumbbells with ease). i stopped doing exercises that hurt. no more reverse-grip curls, no more hammer curls. my motto now is if an exercise hurts or doesnt feel quite right, i stop doing it immediately. no matter how much someone is yacking in your ear how its \"THE BEST EXERCISE FOR MASS$@&amp;*(!\" its not worth injury.\n\n&gt; i truly thought that i was stuck with this injury for the rest of my life and thought that it would impair my weightlifting forever. i spent a lot of time trying to find out how to recover from this injury, so i hope this can help people out there that are suffering from the same injury.\n\n---\n\nMeh, so I guess I have to stop with the curls for a while. :\\ Pretty sure that's the only exercise that's causing my arm to hurt, not the pushups or arnold presses.\n\n\nE2: May be tendonOSIS if ice is not helping... https://baseballthinktank.com/are-you-sure-its-tendonitis-heres-how-you-can-tell"

Could anybody give me some workouts I can try at home to help me out? I have a set of 8lbs dumbbells and a chair and mat, not much else."

  "text": "People like myself know that when they go to the gym to get a good workout in, your outfit somehow kind of matters. You're always faced with the scenario that there will be way more fit people around you, and looking good in their skin tight clothes, EVEN WHEN THEY'RE RUNNING! This automatically makes you feel uncomfortable, and may even prevent you from using certain machines because you don't want them to see you and judge you based on your appearance. First of all, you're going to the gym so you shouldn't care what people think about you because YOU'RE THERE! You didn't come up with another excuse as to why you needed to skip out on the gym and you made it happen! Even though that is sometimes a huge step because the media makes everyone feel bad about themselves, you ignored it. What if though you showed up to the gym already feeling confident because of the cute workout clothes you bought? I know that when I leave the house in a new outfit that I feel is \"on point\" I radiate an amazing positive energy! \n\nVanora Designs strives to create apparel that has you going anywhere feeling comfortable AND confident.

  "text": "I started working out in late 2013, at age 26 when I weighed only 55 kg, with about 4% bodyfat. A friend recommended me the Runtastic Push-Up App. So I did that and managed to do loads of push-ups from the get-go. I peaked at 120 in one go in early 2014. Managed to get up to 65 kg (10% bodyfat) within a few months without focusing on nutrition. Kept on doing about 1000-1500 push-ups a month up to June 2015, when I did 3000-something. What I noticed was that even though I keep doing them without taking long breaks I started to struggle doing as many at once (per set) as I once did. \n\nI decided to join a gym last September. I've added doing leg, arm and core exercises on the machines 3 times a week for 40-60 mins. and investing in whey supplements. Even though I increased weights steadily and focused on eating loads constantly, I only managed to gain 1 kg of muscle mass in 9 months (had a serious flu for one of them).\n\nNow what's worse is, that with every passing month my body seems to age more rapidly when it comes to recovery periods. Stagnating gains, increasing pains. Whereas I would usually just need 2-5 minute warm-ups without feeling muscle aches for more than half a day the next day. Now I do 10 minute warm-ups and the pains even from only doing 75 push-ups last for three days. I feel like wreck. Even when I don't train for a week, the moment I get up in the morning my body feels exhausted. Even sitting upright for a long while aches. Due to the longer and longer breaks I turned that hard-earned muscle mass kilogram into a fat kilogram (just had a body consistency check-up).  \n\nI have no idea how I developed into this? Thinking about going to a doctor, but I don't want painkillers to cover up the symptoms. Where could this change in health stem from? Any suggestions and imput are very appreciated."

I have also notices that they also get slower and they \"lose\" \ntechnique.My coach give me a neurological expain for that, and told me that this is not that an athlete sould try to do .So is there a way to get stronger but stay in the same size (or at least get the minimun grown in size) ? And if there is then how ? (number of sets ? volume in every set ?intensity in every set ? resting between? how many exercise per musle group?what split in days ?)\n2) Through my seacher on internet and some practical experience i have understan that some movements are meant to \"feel\" right because by watching someone doing them u cannot always separate which are performed in the right way and wich they are performed wrong.Plus use of bad technique can lead to some pretty bad injuries .\nα)Is a deadlift \"feeling\" like pushing your hip forward or like lifting with your back and try to stand upright ?\nβ)Is a pull up \"feeling\" to start form an active grip or being in an angled position trying to make your chest touch the bar ?\nγ)Is a  low bar squat \"feeling\" like pushing your but behind ( even if u stoop a little) and bringin it back or like poitning out your knees( not farther that the egde of your feet) and keep your torso in straight line ?\nI ma asking those question about this exerceses cause i feel like the can be a good use in a strength program \nThanks u for all your answers in advice and for your time spend ....(and for SORRY the awfull english)"

On Google it said \"Static stretching is the most commonly performed type of stretching, partly due to it being the safest method of stretching due to the relatively low levels of tension developed. Static stretches can be either active or passive.\" So that means PNF stretching is potentially dangerous compared to normal static stretching?

I've seen a lot of people doing this from the moment I first entered the gym and I don't know where did this way of performing this exercise come from but it's dangerous and ineffective.\n2. Mistake number 2 is going to be: Not fixing your elbows! You're putting stress on your biceps this way of performing the exercise and you are not fully focusing on your traps.\n3. Mistake number 3 is going to be: Going forward with your head! This doesn't have any effect on the focus of your traps and \"trap-vise\" you will get the same results,but this way of performing the exercise can have a negative effect on your posture in the long run.\n\n- I also did a video on this topic on youtube so you can go and check it out if you want.\n \nThe video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NNff2zjhCM\n"

I don't have any special equipments and I don't do it outdoors, so yeah, indoors. I mainly do running on the spot (which at first, only lasted around ten minutes before I feel some pain in my kindey area, but now I can last about 17-18 minutes before feeling that pain). I did some Bodyweight Squats (20 per exercise), Crunches (25 per exercise, sometimes less cause it is very tiring), Push-Ups (15 tops, my arms are quite weak I think) and some Lunges (20 per exercise). I think that my legs actually last longer than my arms. So I have these exercises about twice a week, should I do them more? However, I usually feel some soreness on my muscles after these exercises and I normally don't feel like up to doing more until 3 or more days. Oh and any tips on how to increase my endurance on my arms?\n\nAlso, I read that if you do push-ups, you're really training your chest muscles, but I never feel tired on my chest part. My arms, on the other hand, feel really really exhausted just by doing mere 5 times of it and I usually have to rest around 10 secs before being able to continue.\n\nI eat a lot of fatty foods (I know, it is bad), by fatty foods, I mean a lot of fried or grilled foods. I do eat that Quaker insta-oatmeal though, I heard it's good?\n\nAnyway, those typed here are what I concern the most, for now.

  "text": "Are you ready to bring yourself to the next level of cardio fitness? If you have hit a plateau or are just tired of the same old 2-mile jog on a treadmill, interval training will bring you new and improved results. Interval training involves bursts of high-intensity work followed by periods of low-intensity work. The high-intensity periods are typically at or close to maximum exertion, while the recovery periods may involve either complete rest or activity of lower intensity. A major bonus: it’s proven to burn more fat then standard cardio! You can do interval training on any cardio machine such as: bicycles, elliptical, treadmills, stair masters, etc … You can also do it outside in a pool, on the slopes, jogging trails or other.\n\nWhatever you choose, start with 30-60 second bursts of intense training followed by two to three minutes of training at a moderate pace. As the weeks go by and your fitness level increases, increase the length of your high intensity training and decrease the length of your recovery periods."

I am 21 years old and recently have found out I have GERD, basically bad acid reflux, but it hasnt been a terrible problem until about a few months ago. I was always able to complete a full, hard workout with maxes and everything. Lately, I cant even complete one of my regular workouts. Today was the worst episode of it all. I get very lightheaded(which is typically normal when weightlifting very heavy), but what really hits me hardest is not so much a sharp pain. I of course get horrible acid reflux after pushing heavy weight so my esophagus kills and it makes me feel like I am ready to puke, but it for some reason hurts my trachea as well. After I get these pains, I usually stop and take big breaths and it usually helps me as my body calms back down, but could there be a problem with my lungs? Theres no history of lung or heart problems in my family(besides myself having a tiny heart murmur), just a lot of intestinal troubles which I realize is the root cause of this.

I've been working out about 4x a week mon-thurs. \n\nYesterday, I decided to go to the gym and workout as I was unable to go to the gym on Thursday as work was super busy. Instead of going 2 hours after eating I went 4.5 hours after lunch. I did my regular workout that I normally do on Thursday. I started feeling lightheaded again. Didn't think much of it and pushed through. When I was done with my hour long workout session the intensity started increasing. After about 20 Minutes it became even worse. My arms and legs started shaking and numbing sensation. I started getting cotton mouth really bad and having troubled vision as well a tingling sensation throughout my arms and legs.

  "text": "33yr old male. 5'9\". 12st6lb. Around 18% body fat \n\nIn my 20's I was a regular at the gym. Never really huge but I was really pleased with my definition and body fat around 10%\n\nOver the last 7 years exercise has become much less of a priority, but I'm keen to try stay in shape. \n\nMy primary goal is reducing body fat %. My secondary goal is to retain as much muscle definition as possible. \n\nI understand that diet is king, but my biggest concern is that I don't have the time or motivation to train regularly. Therefore some weeks I'll train 3 times, and then won't see the gym again for a month, and so I've put together a regime with the aim of getting a full body workout without DOMS for the next week.\n\nI always start a workout with 5 min on the rower and end with 30 min on the bike. I try to do one exercise for each muscle with moderate weight. 1 set of 25 reps and adjust the weight to give a slight burn at the end but nowhere near failure, with a focus on keeping my form and full range of motion. \n\nThis weight routine usually lasts around 40 minutes and doesn't leave me in agony for the next 4 days, but I'm wondering if there's anything I could do differently.  \n\nI'm no expert and I'm open to any advice. Thanks for reading."

I only stay for about 1 hour to 1.5 hours.  \n\nThe reason is that it's the time where I can do my routine the fastest since the gym is empty, and it's just an easy time for me to commit too.  The issue that's arisen from this is that I just can't seem to sleep after going.  Usually I end up falling asleep at around 6am, then I have to wake up 2 hours later for work... not ideal. \n\nMy first remedy to this was just to change the time, go in the morning instead of at night.  Isn't working.  I frequently sleep passed my alarm clock.  When I do hear my alarm clock, I find it VERY difficult get up and go.  Granted, this may show that I don't have enough will, but whatever.  If I don't, then I don't.  \n\nSo I've decided to go back to the midnight schedule, I just bought some pills that are Magnesium/Melatonin mix that I'm hoping will work.  However, does anyone else have some other tips for this insomnia issue?  Also, should I take these pills before or after going to the gym?  \n\nExtra notes*  I don't take anything before going to the gym.  I'm also doing IF.

Should I hire a personal trainer in the first place or just get a monthly gym membership and ask them for help? \n\nI'm a rather skinny body type and I want to gain muscle, not become bulky, I don't want to gain so much mass but gain definition. I know it'll be a challenge, I want to make sure I'm doing the correct things to make steps forward towards this goal."

  "text": "Edit: Before anything, I wanna clarify that before summer I was training for a half marathon and by about may I started lifting weights (I barely had any muscle)\n\nFor the first month of summer vacation I was hitting the gym every weekday and gained a lot of muscle until the first week of july where I got lazy since I was in a summer camp and then I went to Spain where I did a pilgrimage (I walked an average of a half marathon every day for six days). I'm starting cross country tomorrow but I wanna blend that with weight lifting (and other non cardio workouts) so that I gain muscle and lose fat. The practices are monday-thursday in the afternoon and I want to work out in the gym in the early morning.\n\nDo you guys think it would be possible to gain muscle while running and sprinting like 5-6 miles everyday with supplements like protein shakes and amino acids?"

  "text": "Hi everyone. I'm 17 and I recently decided to invest in 25$ in a jar of protein powder I've been researching. I've always been athletic and played soccer and basketball my whole life,  but I'm now looking to gain some muscle mass specifically in my arms and chest area. I'm not new to weight lifting but I most of my exercising is done through drills, games or practices which involves lots of running and some arms and core work outs. I plan on taking the extra time each day to develop a more muscular physique. So I have these few questions that have been circling around in my mind:\n1. While doing my research I noticed that I'd have to consume around 3-5 portions of PP each day, which is around 30-33 gs. Considering my age and weight (which is 161 and I'm 6'1), do I need to consume that much each day or can I conserve more of it and make it last for the next month or so?\n2. Should I be using the PP after practices and games where I didn't do much lifting but was mostly running and did a few basic exercises? Would it be wasteful to use it post practice?\n3. Whenever I bench or squat, I usually just do the exact same thing which starts off with 10 reps of 115, then 5 reps of 135, then 10 reps of 115 again, then move down by 20 till 75 where I do 15 reps and then end the chest work out. With squats I just do 3 sets of 10 reps of 45 and then do so lunges and post workout stretches. Should I make it more intense and change it up each work out or is that sufficient enough to make some gains?\n4. Assuming I spend 3-4 hours a week working out in the gym and apply the PP properly, approximately within how much time should I expect to see some progress or see an increase in muscle mass whether during a work out or visible gains? \nThanks.

  "text": "Okay, first off I've been training for a little more than a year now. I go to the gym and train whatever group of muscles I have assigned for that day, quite ordinary.\n\nLast Friday, however, I kind of discovered a new way of working out. Fridays are shoulder (deltoid) days. I didn't feel like going to the gym and so I did it at home. It only took 14 minutes and it was the most insane workout I've ever experienced. All it took was two dumbbells at around 4 kilograms (sounds easy, but you can take whatever you want). \n\n**READ BELOW FOR THE ACTUAL WORKOUT!**\n\nHave a clock or something like that handy and grab your dumbbells (4 kg for me). When the clock hits a full minute, [start doing lateral raises](http://fitnessanddefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/lateral_raises.jpg). Do this for 40 seconds, then start [dumbbell pressing](http://www.building-muscle101.com/images/dumbel_press.jpg) for another 40 seconds. Lastly you do [bent over lateral raises](http://www.xuvn.com/fitdirector/Strength%20training/Shoulder/bent-over-lateral-raise.png), again for 40 seconds. \n\nKeep in mind there shouldn't be a second of rest in between the exercises. Rest for a minute, then start over (you can do 20 seconds of each if it's too hard). Do the rounds three to five times, in total you should have made something like nine to fifteen sets.  I did it with 40 seconds the first round, but I could only do 20 seconds for the last four rounds. \n\nSo to sum up you should train continuously for somewhere around three to ten minutes with two to four minutes of rest. \n\nI hope I helped someone! Have a good day and remember to stay hydrated. "

My dad recently decided to talk to my doctor about them and he said she said that none of it really works at all and that creatine really does nothing. I have looked up online and researched my reasoning behind taking it. I also have friends that swear by both of them and have taken both whey and creatine after working out and say it helps muscles. I'm kinda torn and don't really know whats what between who to believe so I figured I'd try and ask all you kind people here as to if whey and creatine actually benefit your muscle growth and work out performance."

I could do:\nA: 30min for 6 days and rest on the 7th or B: 1.5h on 2 days (assuming you do work outs which are balanced and do not focus on specific muscles)\nI heared \"progression\" is faster or is even only possible if you do B, because you have to go as close to your limits as you can in order to improve. Doing A simply holds you on the level you are already. So it is technically better to invest the same time(per week) on less but longer work out sessions?

If someone has a plan, with steps or whatever ,before someone just told me to get a bike, which is cool and all, but I'm really looking for an actual routine, details would be really appreciated. I also don't really have any workout gear, and am not really able to afford to buy anything at the moment.

I have been doing a low carb diet. My question is is it correct that I need to consume carbs to build muscle. My friend told me to continue to be on the low carb diet, but I assume you need to start eating more carby foods, to build muscle. I know it matters what of carby you consume you need healthy food, not fast food a processed foods. But what is the balance on eating the right amount food and working out. I imagine if you don't workout enough you gain weight, rather then build. So do I need to work out excessively to keep up with the amount of food I'm eating. And some quick questions are bars okay like meal replacers, protein etc, what are some good bars. How many meals should I eat. When should I eat before work out or after.

  "text": "I just turned 16 [m]. Almost off for the summer and I want to do as much as I can.  \n\nHere is some background on were I am at. I'm been working out off and on for about the last three years. I weigh 150 and I'm 6' 2. I haven't had major success that's for sure.  You can see the muscle but it just bla.  I've got plenty of inspiration. I don't think that is the problem. But whenever I start a new workout or program I always go into the first 2 weeks strong. Then I start to feel like it's not helping. I don't feel the stiffness the next day. I don't feel it right after either. So I just kinda give up on it. I hate myself for doing it. But if I continue to keep going with a program it seems like my form is bad. Just the drive to do it is gone. Anyways, I bet you can understand my struggles.\nSo this summer I really want to do as much as I can. I need to find something that makes me feal like I'm really doing something worth while. As I said before I'm at 150lb now. My goal is to reach 165 before these 3 months are over.  \nIf anyone has some really good ideas or advice I'd love to hear about them. Feel free to send me a message too. Be happy to chat about it. Thanks for your time"

  "text": "I have an odd concept to ask about. When people work their body they think of tensing up the muscles. Thing is muscles work both ways, as much as they can compress they should be able to relax.\nI know already the benefits of this, some of which are smoother motion and impact absorption (think striking a pillow rather than a rock).\nI encountered this in a form of shaolin style. Has anyone else heard of this?\nThe only thing I find when searching for information on such training is 'feel good' new age. While there is value to that sort of thing, I'm interested at the moment in some more serious professional approach."

I'm not sure exactly what my weight goal is, but I know I want to significantly gain muscle mass. My upper body is very frail. We work out six days a week, but it's never the same focus on a body part every day.\n\nWhile working out, my friend told me to take a few protein supplements. I was just wondering what you all thought of the following products and/or what your experiences with them were:\n\nJack3d Micro - take one 30-45 minutes before working out. \n\nKre alkalyn Creatine - take 30-45 minutes before working out.\n\nUp Your Mass protein shake - take after working out. My biggest concern with this is that each protein shake I mix with water contains over 500 calories and has 46 grams of protein? I know protein is great for working out, but is that much protein from a protein shake healthy?\n\nI've been working out for two weeks now and already see major improvements. However, I just added the protein supplements to my routine as of today. \n\nWhat do you all think of these supplements? Also, is there anything you would advise a really motivated, but incredibly new, guy in working out? I've browsed through this discussion board quite a bit, but I may have missed something.\n\nThanks."

Most people I met say that I am strong but I don t look like or feel strong. My arms are quite small tho it seems like my legs and my back are the strongpoints ( can t do pullups). I tried losing weight over these 3 years, tried a lot of diets and other things but I had no results and I still hate the way I look. And since last year I started to workout less since I feel pain in my elbows and wrists and they hurt me most when bench pressing some \"decent\" weight. \n  Now what should I do to lose the weight ? And maybe fix the problems with my arms.. from what I've observed my metabolism is on the slow side.. also I want to be taller, if that's possible somehow.. I just hate that I am overweight and my belly is quite big and makes me feel insecure.. \n  "

A little info, I have played soccer my whole life, so I have been pretty skinny, but I am an average height of 6 feet tall and also 20 years of age in college currently.\n\nSo my plan is the PHUL workout plan, but I have modified it a bit. Days 3 and 7 are both rest days.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDay 1: Upper Body Heavy Weight\n\n\nFlat Bench Press: 4 sets, 3-5 Reps\n\n\nIncline Dumbbell Fly: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nBent Over Barbell Row: 4 Sets, 3-5 Reps\n\n\nLat Pull Down: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nOverhead Press: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nBarbell Curl: 4 Sets, 3-5 Reps\n\n\nBarbell Preacher Curl: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nOverhead Dumbbell Dip: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nFinish with a 10 Minute Run\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDay 2: Legs Heavy Weight\n\n\nStart with 10-15 minute bike ride (Light, to warm up legs)\n\n\nSquat: 4 Sets, 3-5 Reps\n\n\nLunges: 4 Sets, 6 Reps\n\n\nLeg Press: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nLeg Curls: 4 Sets, 6-10 Reps\n\n\nStanding Calf Raise: 4 Sets, 15 Reps\n\n\nFinish with 3 Sets of Abs Circuit\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDay 4: Upper Body Hypertrophy\n\n\nIncline Barbell Bench Press: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nFlat Bench Dumbbell Fly: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nSeated Cable Row: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nOne Arm Dumbbell Row: 4 Sets, 8 -12 Reps\n\n\nDumbbell Lateral Raise: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nConcentrated Curls: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nHammer Curls: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nTricep Cable Pulldown: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDay 5: Legs Hypertrophy\n\n\n10-15 minutes Bike (light to warm up legs)\n\n\nFront Squat: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nBarbell Lunge: 4 Sets, 10 Reps\n\n\nLeg Extension, Leg Curl (Super Set): 4 Sets, 10-15 Reps\n\n\nSeated Calf Raise: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\nStanding Calf Raise: 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDay 6: Core and Running\n\n\n15 Minute Run\n\n\n3 Sets of ab circuit along with 3 sets of core circuit\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nNow that I have laid out my workout plan I will tell you my goals and what I eat.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nGoals: I started out at 134 pounds and have managed to go up to 145 pounds while remaining at roughly 10% body fat (measured at 143.5 pounds). My goal is to get up to 155-160 pounds and then cut from there. Right now I am eating about 3000 calories a day with my macros at 40% carbs, 40% protein, and 20% fat (admittedly this has been skewed the past couple weeks cause of the holidays, don't @ me cookies are good lol). \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo looking at my goals and current workout plan I have a couple questions for you guys.\n\n\n- Is my workout plan going to get me where I want to get to? Am I missing anything critical\n\n\n- Diet wise, is this about where I should be at for macros and caloric intake to get a good steady/ healthy weight gain?"

  "text": "I started using a heavy punching bag about a month ago and before that, I've never touched a punching bag in my life. Before i started using it i learned how to properly punch, if I could use it with or without gloves and how to do kicks. When i started i was hitting it soft so i get the hang of it (without gloves because i wanted to strengthen my wrist and knuckles). The first day i was fine, took a day of rest and then started again the next morning, the second time my wrist got really badly hurt, so i used the R.I.C.E method for my hands and i took 2 days without using a punching bag but i was still going to the gym, my wrist were hurting when i did curls. So i took days of the gym, almost a week past and i was getting annoyed that my wrist weren't healing fast enough, so i went to the gym one day at night (even though my hand still hurted) i started using the punching bag and i was ignoring the pain and when i finished my workout my hands actually felt better, idk how punching helped but It did. So my question is how did my knuckles get used to punching a heavy bag so fast even though i was a beginner and most people recommended to take it slow and start with gloves. Btw im a skinny tall guy, i weigh 158 pounds, and im 6 ft and 3 in. "

  "text": "Obesity and being overweight as a whole is an \"issue\" in lots of areas and experienced in countless households populating this planet. All of us really want the absolute best for our youngsters and seeing them grow healthy and consuming[ good naturally healthy food](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/smart-foods-before-working-out) is on the mind of all families. Several battle getting their aspect across and might potentially select negative encouragement to ensure good routines, therefore today we will be looking at a number of tips that could aid you foster healthy food habits in kids.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/n7ukyogu1br11.jpg\n\n**Define food as fuel**\n\nDraw a similarity between a high-performance vehicle and your kid's physical body by going over the value of adding the correct amount of high-octane fuel (food items) into the tank and providing the engine appropriate upkeep with frequent exercise. That example sets you right up to inform about \"what sorts of foods items we must be taking in to improve performance\". Develop a household interpretation of healthy and balanced meals, and pursue them. It really helps to compare high-octane fuel (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, nuts and seeds, and also healthy proteins) and once-in-a-while foods such as chips and biscuits. Never outlaw specific foods or make restricted foods rewards though, since doing this can lead children to sneak, stockpile or overindulge on restricted products.\n\n**Blaze a trail**\n\nYou are your youngster's 1st example when it comes to how to live a well-balanced lifestyle and look after your body. In case you're worried about your child's body weight, you need to modify your personal consuming and exercise patterns as well. Think about a few improvements you can come up with together, regardless if it's dropping sugar-sweetened refreshments or staying away from junk food. According to a new investigation, when it comes to youngsters ages 2 to 5, snack food consumes 28 percent of overall calorie consumption. And snack times explain 47 percent of refreshments taken in daily. So it's vital to make snacking matter nutritionally.\n\n**Make activity a household social occasion**\n\nSet a [weekly physical-activity objective](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/diversification-rules). This could possibly incorporate family walks, bicycle trips, activities of football or Frisbee, or anything else your youngsters enjoy. If they're into video games, get one which's dance-based or includes a few other movement-oriented activity every person can take pleasure in.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/vrv1xavv1br11.jpg\n\n**Give praises for their work.**\n\nAs opposed to paying attention to outcomes of the improvements your kid is helping make, provide constructive feedback about how much they're trying. Also teens are frantic for positive affirmation from their families.\n\n**Stay on top of social networks.**\n\nMultiple research studies report likely powerful negative affiliations among social media visibility and kids' body perception. But 2017 study discovered that favorable adult impact and a helpful school atmosphere go a long way towards alleviating damaging results amongst girls ages 12 to 14. Therefore speak honestly with your youngsters concerning what they're experiencing on their social media.\n\nOur team trust that you have understood at minimum a bit from this brief writeup and would manage to stronger promote healthy and balanced food habits in your kids. Bear in mind that everything begins at the basis (You!) however with commitment and aim in mind, you can do just about anything."

Basically, the main lifts are done 4x6, with starting at 70% of 1RM and ramping up to 80%. On the last week, the last set is an AMRAP to see if any progress was made and/or set a new rep/volume PR. The next cycle I will increase starting weight with 2,5% ( or calculate new 1RM based on the AMRAPset) and start over. At the same time the sets/week of eaxh muscle group is increasing. Starting of with 12 sets per week and ending with 20. Im going to train each muscle 2x a week were i alternate between Squats/Front suats and Bench/ Incline bench for example. The variation of the main lift will be done in a higher rep range and progress will be made by adding weight when hitting rep goal, adding reps, slowing down the eccentric phase and so on. The extra sets wach week are added to the accesory lifts (an example for chest: Incline bench, Squeeze press) and also on isloation work that is very minimal at the start (like 2x15) or even adding an extra exersice for the muscle group. Before beginning a new cycle I will deload. Thanks ahead guys!"

  "text": "Just finally realized that an adhesion is my problem, not tendonitis as I'd thought for the past year. It was the cause of an ongoing \"tennis elbow\" problem as well. Pretty much every part of my arm got better once I started trigger point therapy on the knot. My shoulder doesn't hurt much at all and the \"tennis elbow\" is almost nonexistant...in the course of 24 hours.\n\nThis adhesion is sore as hell now that I've been trigger-pointing it out. I know this is pretty common because when I was looking into treating my tennis elbow last January-ish, I came across some guy in a workout forum who mentioned a \"knot\" in his tricep was the cause of his problem. I thought then that it might be the cause of my problem as well but finally just found the proper treatment. I've tried all kinds of different things before discovering this trigger point massage.\n\nSo, I'm just wondering if anyone else had this here and roughly how long it takes to reverse the problem. I don't want to overdo it with the massage. Currently, it feels like a big bruise on the back of my arm. I hope it's not an ongoing thing where scar tissue just wants to keep reforming after I massage it out. The fact that it's been sitting there for a year worries me."

Right now, doing basic curls I can only manage 12 reps in each arm at a constant speed at 25 pounds in the first set. I can only do 5 chin-ups in a row. The real shocker is that I can only hold a plank for 1:20... I think healthy is at least 2:00. This is really bad but I haven’t ran a timed mile since freshmen year (I’m a junior now) and I finished it in 7:00, now probably 7:30-8:00 minutes. I don’t have a gym membership but I could probably get one, I have weights (curling ones not bench) at home that go up to 30 in each :( and protein shake powder at my disposal. That should be enough information to base it off of, thanks a lot to anyone that can help."

I have been biking every day for an hour (10-12 miles per ride) for about a month but I haven't seen any improvements. I just ran today but I could only do about 20 minutes (walk/run) before I basically died. To me, the running felt like a more \"workout-y\" workout because I am already feeling sore. When I biked for an hour, my fitbit said I burned about 420 calories, and when I ran for 20, it was 191. So my question is- is it better for me to run 20-30 minutes per day or to bike an hour per day? End goal is losing lbs and inches preferably within 2 months"

  "text": "By Nicoletta Orphanou. Category : Health\n\nHave you decided to begin working out but are not sure which workout is best for you? We have researched about the matter and are about to clear things out for you.\n\nFirst of all, congratulations on your decision! Before starting out, think of all those benefits you will get out of this. It is not only a healthier body or just shedding a few extra pounds. Being more active will boost not only your stamina but your psychology as well.\n\nAs a Greek ancient proverb says, “Well begun, half done!” So, take a deep breath and make sure you will do your best from the beginning, because that’s the greatest way to start something new.\n\nPeople have various needs when working out; for example, some want a flatter belly, others want to lose weight, others want to gain more muscle, and others want to relax and take off some stress.\n\nFor body shaping and relaxation\n\nIn order to shape up and release some everyday stress, you can try joining Yoga or Pilates classes. Both help in shaping your body. If you want to loose weight as well, you should also join some aerobic or cardio workouts to burn the extra fat. There are also some Yoga workouts that are more adapted to fat loss, so make sure you ask which types of Yoga are available at your gym.\n\nFor weight loss\n\nIf you feel summer and your bathing suit ringing an alarm to remind you about those extra pounds, one of the fastest ways to burn fat is with cardio or aerobic exercises. This helps increase your heart rate at a zone that is said to burn fat. If you prefer being outdoors, you can, of course; try running or fast walking for 20-30 minutes every day.\n\nA very helpful way for fat burning and weight loss is the run-walk method. This comprises of a normal walk during the first five minutes for a warm-up and is then followed by alternating periods of fast running and walking. If you are a beginner, you can try out and see which periods suit you better. For example, some prefer running for one minute and walking for another one or two. Others run the fastest they can for 30 seconds or one minute, followed by a one-minute walk.\n\nWeight loss, gaining muscle mass, increasing endurance\n\nThere are many workouts to follow in this case, but beware that they are all intense workouts and not for everyone. If your doctor thinks you could join such a workout, then you have a lot to choose from, such as Crossfit, TRX, Tabata, HIIT, and Spinning.\n\nSpecific problem areas\n\nIf you want to focus on a specific area, you should get advice from your gym trainers and they will add more exercises to the area you want to focus on, like your abs, legs, etc. You do need to work out the rest of the body as well, though, to get balanced and lasting results.\n\nDo try to keep up with your workout; you can freely change and try other types of exercises if you feel one doesn’t fit you, but don’t give up! The beginning may be hard, but it’s well worth the whole change your body and soul will ensue.\n\n"

Until two years ago, I always worked jobs that required me to be on my feet all day. I recently acquired a desk job with better pay (woo!) but to my chagrin, I no longer have easy access to light exercise all day. In my personal life I enjoy hiking, skiing, skateboarding and cycling. I am not overweight, just out of shape. My fitness goals are simple (and here's where I need help, most likely): get rid of the moobs, strengthen my core, build upper body strength, continue to do cardio training (ever skateboarded for an hour straight?). I am fully aware that my fitness goals will need to be met by nutrition changes in order for any progress to be made. This is where you guys come in. I am a six-year vegetarian (please don't ask why) and I generally cook my own food except for the occasional burrito or sandwich once or twice a week. I only eat once, maybe twice a day.

For example:\nWeek One\nMon, Wed, Fri - Workout A\nTues, Thurs - Workout B\nWeek One\nMon, Wed, Fri - Workout B\nTues, Thurs - Workout A\nAnd repeating. I have access to a treadmill, a stepper, an elliptical, and dumbbells. I'm mainly looking to increase the number of push-ups and curl-ups I can do, and running faster as I plan to join the Navy, but I also want to keep my workouts balanced by working on other areas. "

The English is broken and muddled, the format is disorganized and there are parts with only German instructions. \n\nThis is a review of \"Cali Moves\" a calisthenic workout program by Sven Kohl and El Eggs.\n\nIf you're like me, you found their YouTube videos quite helpful. The quality of their YouTube videos, however, does not carry over to the paid workout program. The program, which is about $150, is extremely difficult to understand. You will find yourself, almost at every paragraph saying \"this can't mean what it says\" because it would not make sense as written. Some of the videos are listed in German only. Every time you want to workout you have to sit with the program for at least a half hour trying to figure out what they are trying to say. It is that bad.\n\nIf you really want to know what this program is like, take $150, burn it, flush it down the toilet and then induce a migraine by reading a telephone book shrunk down to a 3 point font."

It does not mean that if you workout in evening you can not loose weight or or if you workout in morning you can't gain weight.There are so many other factors also(Workout routine,nutrition,sleep duration etc)."

I'm a thin guy with a little definition. Not completely skinny with no muscle. I've always wanted to work out and get into better shape. My job is physical and usually through that work up to 143lbs but get laid off (construction). It's always hard cause making back that 13 lbs in 2-2.5 months is painful. I'd like to just make it part of my lifestyle and go beyond my working weight and be able to maintain that. I quit smoking about 3 weeks ago and this time I feel as though it's the time and I've started eating way better etc. \n\nI've found that previous times that ive tried to workout I wouldn't have as much motivation and wasn't as serious. Id workout the first time really and push myself too far and would for instance not be able to lift my arm more than a few inchs without wincing. Mostly in the joint area between forearm and bicep. Maybe tendons or sore muscle? \n\nI just don't know where to start with beginner workouts that will give me slow enough yet quick enough progress to at least get my muscles in a happy place where they are actually ready to handle a workout. I don't want to try again and be out for days cause the pain is undoable. I understand there should be soreness.. that's why they say ripped etc but it has been extreme a few times and didn't end up going back. Any advice of workouts, weights and reps to start with.. signs I should watch for. And when I should feel comfortable to take the next step. I know I need to start somewhat slow but don't want to start lifting 5lbers ya know. I can do 20-25 for 10reps up to 4-5 sets from what I recall but that's where the issue lies. It feels okay at the time but not after. Sorry if the post is long and I appreciate your time and opinion. \n\nRight now I have body weight and dumbbells with weights, also was thinking of using a camping cooler as a bench with dumbbells for now. Want to start at home until I feel more confident and less distracted at gym and know what I need to do. Thanks again. \n"

  "text": "Hey guys, I've been struggling with this state for several months. I really enjoyed working out, exercising etc. but now I'm in this kind of anhedonia when I work out and I just don't care, there's no passion, no enjoyment as it used to be. I tried other work outs, crossfit and so on but everytime it just end up with me saying \"Why the hell am I even doing this?\". I am the kind of person who doesn't have goals or something to achieve. The best quote for me would be \"Happiness is found on the way not at the end of the roas\". So as you can see I have to do something that makes me happy otherwise I will quit it. I'm 18 years old, so I don't know if this is some stage of puberty or anhedonia. I really want to be in shape, be strong, fast etc. (and of course I want to look good) but EVERYTIME when I work out I get to the phase when I just don't want to do it, because my mind is somewhere else. \nThanks for every advice.\n\nEDIT: I never had a \"gym buddy\" and I've never needed one. I only went to the gym alone and worked out alone, do you think it's time to change that and start to work out with someone? I always worked out alone and I didn't mind but maybe now I do mind, what do you think?"

It may look lame but the intensity is there, good for those trying to burn some extra calories. Trust me I've tried it and its not as easy as you may think! I challenge those who are strong to complete at least 3 rounds and if you can do leave a comment down below!\n\nHowever do take note, this quick workout is NOT to build muscle as building muscle requires volume and periodization. However if you're looking to shred some fat or someone who likes to try out new stuff and take a challenge then this quick home workout is for u!

Try adding these to your routine.\n\nLateral Jumps\nLateral jumps might seem simple, but as long as you’re doing them in proper form, your cardio, strength and endurance will be pushed to their limits within seconds.\n\nStand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nJump out of your stance sideways towards the right side, then cross your left foot behind the right foot with a slightly bent forward posture.\nFrom that position, repeat with your other foot for as many reps as you can.\n\nJump Squats\nHere’s another straightforward exercise that offers remarkable results. To do a jump squat,\n\nStand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nHold your arms out in front of you, and slowly lower your butt straight down.\nMake sure your butt doesn’t go lower than your knees.\nAt the bottom of that range of motion, push yourself away from the ground in an explosive, upward jump.\nLand on your feet with your knees slightly bent, never locked, to absorb the shock of your jump and prevent injuries.\n\nDumbbell Squat\nStand with your feet shoulder-width apart with a dumbbell in each hand, and slowly lower your butt straight down.\nMake sure to hold your head facing forward, keep your eyes looking straight ahead, and keep your spine in a 90-degree angle to your knees.\nReach down as far as possible with the dumbbells and then come back to starting position.\n\nDouble Butt Kick\nStand with your feet shoulder-width apart and pointing forward.\nThen jump up as high as you possibly can and try to kick your heels up to meet your butt in mid-air before landing on the ground in the starting position.\nBe sure to bend your knees and flex your ankles to absorb the impact of the landing.\n\nDumbbell Lunges\nAgain, start with your feet shoulder-width apart and pointing forward while holding a dumbbell in each hand.\nStep forward with one foot while the other remains in its original position.\nBend both knees into an almost kneeling position but don’t let either knee touch the ground.\nAfter getting as low as possible, return to the starting position and repeat with the other foot.\nAny of these exercises -- or a combination of them -- can boost endurance and strength for muscle groups in the legs including the glutes, quads and hamstrings."

I realize there are much better times to work out, but I have school and then basketball afterwards. It's not that it's impossible or inconvenient to work out earlier, it's just that I'm not really motivated to work out until I really have nothing else to occupy my time with other than sleep. So is it bad, okay, or just useless to work out so late?"

  "text": "We all want firm and sexy abs. Try these ab exercises and find the one that fits your fitness needs. Before you begin, select weights that compliment your fitness level. Remember, the slower your repetitions, the more burn you’ll feel and the quicker you’ll see results.\n\nJumping Rope\n\nUse the correct form and technique and a weighted jump rope, and – surprise! – you’ve got the recipe for a killer ab workout. This well-rounded full-body workout engages core muscles, strengthening your entire torso. Not only does it target abs, it also improves your posture. A regular 5 to 10 minute daily routine will have you well on your way to rock hard abs.\n\nBikini Swing\n\nThis upright ab workout takes you beyond crunches, strengthening your entire core, improving posture and stamina. Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, slightly bend your knees and hips. Grasp the end of the dumbbell in your fingers and swing the dumbbell back between your legs. Bring your hips forward and swing the dumbbell back to chest level. Repeat 10 to 12 times to complete a circuit.\n\n- See more at: http://www.fitnessrepublic.com/fitness/exercises/10-ab-exercises-using-weights.html"

  "text": "**My entire body feels sore, now what?**\n\nAnd so, particularly when it comes to people who are at the beginning of their freshly planned workout routines, sore legs and/or arms will absolutely wager a factor. Whenever you feel painful you kind of need to analyze on your own regarding the amount of \"ache\" you are dealing with. Regardless, aim to hold off the craving of taking a seat for extended periods of times when you feel marginal to medium amounts of discomfort.\n\nAlternatively, do a light workout and keep your body engaged.\n\nIn case you experience extreme pain and/or soreness, it should be considered to be a good indication that your body is informing you that you should tone down your workout plan and you've forced yourself too far. Greater discomfort does not actually mean greater outcomes, but in fact means workout quality and effectiveness.\n\n[light &amp; leaf Fashion Active Wear](https://i.redd.it/lgw7gl4xi2811.jpg)\n\n**Slimming down - cardio or strength-based workouts?**\n\nCardio is for stamina and strength training is for muscle mass building. Choose the one you want depending on your physical result wishes.\n\nHaving said that, what we do like to state here at light &amp; leaf is that we prefer to choose both. There are a multitude of workout routines (think HIIT) which incorporates both muscle building and endurance to acquire both results simultaneously, and the majority of people like the results of both of these.\n\n**Heart rate zones? Is there a zone that should be targeting?**\n\nQuick answer: Yes. Long answer: Not really.\n\nBetween the elite sportsmen in addition to endurance runners (which we are supposing the majority of our audiences typically aren't), heart rate zones are checked intensively as they are wanting to improve their career. As far as we go is attempting to trigger the \"Afterburner Effect\"; the effect of your body burning calories well after your workout has been finished. If you want to reach this effect, you have to push your heart rate high enough by carrying out physical exercises such as cycling, using the elliptical, rowing, weight lifting or the good old sprinting.\n\nNaturally, doing any of the exercise routines would be hard to do without the proper workout gear and therefore we 'd like to redirect your attention to our website (**click** [here](https://www.lightleaf.store)) to find a great selection of choices that focuses on performance as well as a fashion edge that will rock your world.\n\nLet us know how you feel about these tips by leaving a comment below."

  "text": "Almost everyone understands that exercising is excellent for the fitness of your physique. Via perspiration you have the opportunity to shape and mold your body to your preferred appeals and make your physical attractiveness more substantial. There are on the other hand a number of advantages that are less typically known and because of that, we will go over 5 less known benefits of exercising.\n\n**# 1. Brain exercise**\n\nExercising is connected to improved memory capability and speedier captivation of information. There are reports which propose that it could also put off and even avoid the start of Alzheimer's disease, an illness which lots of people nowadays are sadly having to deal with.\n\nSomething that has not yet been able to be clarified by researchers is yet another beneficial effect of exercising is greatly improving the blood stream flow to the human brain, promoting the development of new brain cells and vessels caused by the protein BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). It additionally safeguards brain cells from deterioration.\n\n**# 2. Increase your overall happiness**\n\nOther than looking much better after you are busy doing your workout schedules and the benefits that come with it (in addition to the admirations), there certainly is in fact a biological factor behind it. Base ding on tons of researches, walking and/or cycling sets off the discharge of specific chemicals in the brain (serotonin, norepinephrine, endorphins, dopamine) that alleviate signs of depression.\n\n[High Quality Fashion Active Wear](https://i.redd.it/qrkulj2r81911.jpg)\n\n**# 3. Live longer**\n\nPhysical exercise has demonstrated that it could likely stretch you lifespan by 5 years. [A new study](http://time.com/4426572/exercise-dna-telomeres/?iid=sr-link2) done on 10 healthy men and women were requested to perform a 45-minute cycling workout to display what it would do on a molecular level. Outcomes of the screening revealed there to be an increase of a compound that guards your cells, which in turn would result in aging slower than those who do not.\n\n**# 4. Better looking skin**\n\nWhenever you increase your body temperature as you do your training routines, yet another less known benefit of exercising is a better-looking skin. The blood flow accelerates together with the delivery of much needed oxygen and vitamins and mineral are supplied at a notably greater rate. This has 2 unique advantages; boost the health and wellness of your skin as well as help wounds recover quicker.\n\nThis is the major reason why it is very important to cool down adequately and to try to keep moving so that the muscles don't atrophy. But you could also think of this advantage when you have been harmed and should certainly do light-duty activity as it would in fact aid you recuperate quicker.\n\n**# 5. Helping your body shrink fat cells**\n\nFrequent physical exercise will make it possible for your body to get far better at reducing your fat cells (every person has them, some larger than others). Shedding excess fat calls for lots of oxygen, when you routinely partake in routines, your body will have the ability to metabolize the fat cells (that in turn produce chemicals that cause inflammation) will reduce and you'll suffer less from inflammation.\n\nFor more benefits of exercising and great workout gear, follow us by clicking the link [here](https://lightleaf.store/collections/new-arrival).

  "text": "Over the past few years I have been really stressed by school and haven't had much time to workout (even though I am fairly active). I've always been extremely skinny but in the past year or two I've started to gain a little belly fat while maintaining my skinny frame. This summer I got an internship and decided to really focus the whole summer on bulking. I started about 8 weeks ago and it has really been working. I started at 154 lb and am now at 173 lb so I have had a net gain of 19 pounds (I am about 5'11). Essentially I have just been eating like crazy, having a ton of mass gainer, and workout almost every day. The first few weeks I was looking much better but recently my belly fat has really been getting out of control. I still have a fairly skinny frame but I strongly feel it is time to start a cut to get rid of my belly fat. Because I want to maintain my muscle and still grow my frame I was wondering by what method I should cut. I don't know if I should continue weight lifting every day or do some cardio. How many carbs should I take out of my diet (one daily serving of mass gainer is about 250 grams of carbs). I would love hear what the Reddit community suggests. "

  "text": "A healthy dish contains carbohydrates as well as healthy protein. Comparing artificial sweet things as well as fatty food to treats which integrate carbohydrates and also healthy protein will show you that the latter option leaves you with a lot more energy and mood to work out more.\n\nTherefore, if you want that banging summertime body you should definitely consider stocking up on the following:\n\n**Bananas**\n\nConsisting of a great deal of magnesium as well as potassium which are amongst the crucial nutrients that you must absorb each day. Renewing these minerals to your body in addition to the all-natural sugars (not factory produced), will certainly provide you that little bit of added power to killing it in the gym. \\* TIP \\* If you want to add a healthy protein, take into consideration making a peanut butter banana sandwich; simple, healthy and tastes awesome!\n\n[Healthy Fruits and Nuts for Workout](https://i.redd.it/rsoxcvlt2va11.jpg)\n\n**Berries, Grapes, and Oranges**\n\nVitamins are located in abundance within these fruits. Conveniently digested as well as loaded with power boosters and also keep your body through hydration. If you are wanting to include some healthy protein to enhance your meal, yoghurt would be the way to go.\n\n**Nuts**\n\nWhen you are wanting to absorb some fats (not to fret, everybody requires them), ensure you are selecting the \"healthy and balanced\" fats by checking out the nut section of your local grocery store. They are a terrific resource of lasting power before your exercises. You can also couple them with dried out or fresh fruit. Nevertheless, remember that not every person refines food in their belly similarly that you do. See to it that you consume these well prior to your exercise, if you forget you may get stomach cramps.\n\nFor even more details on food relevant write-ups to your exercise or exercise equipment that is useful and also has a style side, do not hesitate to take a look at our on-line shop [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/www.lightleaf.store)"

  "text": "Not everyone has the luxury of working out on a daily or semi-daily basis. However, did you know that you can, instead of not doing anything at all, create a 10-minute time frame to get yourself sweating and move in with what you were doing. In this article we are going to show you 4 exercises that you could simply with an exercise bench.\n\n**The Deadbug**\n\nHow: Lie down facing upwards, arms and knees facing upwards but knees bent 90 degrees. Then while maintaining contact with the floor using your lower back, brace your core and slowly lower one of your legs stretching out and stretch the opposite arm overhead. Keep this pose for a couple of seconds and reverse. \n\n**Do as many of these reps as possible in 30 seconds, then rest 10 seconds. Do 3 of these sets you’re done!**\n\n**Bulgarian Split Squat**\n\nHow: Stand about 1 meter away from your exercise bench and place one foot on it while facing away from the bench, while slightly “bend the knee” (I know you got this reference). Now slowly but surely, while keeping your torso forward and back straight, lower your body until you feel it pulling. \n\n**Do as many of these reps as possible in 30 seconds, then rest 10 seconds. Switch legs and repeat, do these 3 times… NEXT!**\n\n**Push-up into Inverted Shoulder Press**\n\nHow: Place your hands slightly wider than shoulder width and straighten your body horizontally. Then bend your elbows as far as your chest is almost touching the floor and hold for a couple of seconds. Then raise your hips and press into your heels while straightening your arms. Lastly, from that position bend your elbows again while lowering your head until it almost touches the floor and straighten your arms again.\n\n**A bit of a doozy, but do as many of those in 30 seconds, rest 10 seconds. Another 3 of these reps and you’re almost done!**\n\n**Upright Bird Dog**\n\nHow: Sit tall on your exercise bench and grab the ledge with both ends. Scoot forward until your hips and butt are in front of the bench. Now press your shoulders down and away from the ears while bracing your core muscles and reach with your arm straight forward while slightly lifting the opposite foot (as in the first exercise). Take a brief rest and do the opposite. \n\n**Do as many of these as possible in 30 seconds, then rest 10 seconds and you are done!**\n\nFor more tips on working out and getting yourself in shape for this hot and crazy summer, follow us on Instagram, or check out (Workout Tutorial GIFs) on our [website](https://lightleaf.store/blogs/news/got-10-minutes-a-day-for-this-total-body-workout-it-s-all-you-need-to-stay-in-shape-and-get-your-sweat-on) light &amp; leaf to get your shot at the latest SUMMER SALE at 20% OFF."

  "text": "My arms used to be kinda skinny, but I was able to build up enough muscle to where I look pretty big. I'm not at my ideal body fat % but I have been getting much closer recently to where I need to be. Unfortunately, as you work out more often, you need to up your weight or your reps and as time goes on, you find yourself having to workout longer while doing more of everything to achieve a good workout. At first it feels great since I can lift heavier, or run longer/faster, but I almost dread working out now because I *know* I have to do heavier weights or tons of reps, which after a while sucks so hard. It's not enjoyable, it just sucks. \n\nI just wanted to see if anyone else felt the same way. It's like if you have a great body that you like, you have to make sure you go and suffer for 35 mins to an hour or else you lose it. Almost like a lose-lose scenario."

  "text": "Diet:\nMost of your groceries should come from the produce section. The best meat for losing weight is fish. For developing muscle mass, try chicken. For snacks eat kiwi, cantaloupe, banana, etc. Nuts like almonds are great snacks too. \nStop eating the Indian food as frequently. It's all about moderation. \n\nWorkout. \nDon't start off doing everything. Get in shape first. Find a trail or track nearby and jog. Push yourself but not at the expense of your knees. I've a bad knee and running used to hurt it so I would use an elliptical and bike. I run 8 miles everyday now without pain (shedding some weight may help your knees). Do cardio for about 30 min daily. \n\nStart by doing muscle building with exercises not requiring equipment such as push ups, sit ups, crunches, dips, and Pilates. Most of these do 2-4 sets and do as many reps until failure. You can find workout videos for Pilates online or buy a book or vid for them. \n\nI hope this helps. For encouragement, I lost 50 lbs by doing this since January. You can get started this summer and keep up your routine when returning to university. Good luck!"

  "text": "Building strong abs are relatively simple, they heal quickly so they can be done multiple times a week. Doing them properly is key, a crunch is bringing your ribs to you hips or reverse crunch hips to ribs, sit ups if not employing that motion are next to useless. Another way to develop a strong core is to do dead lifts, or squats, your core is constantly engaged trying to stabilize itself. \n\nBut to be perfectly clear, you can work your abs until you are blue in your face, if you do not eat properly and do tons of cardio your abs will never show to the point you will like, because there is a layer of fat over top obstructing the definition of the muscle tone. I recommend interval cardio, or Tabata training to really blast that fat away. Spot reduction is a myth, so the more you work your abs, it does not reduce the fat around your belly to really make them pop.\n\nSo in summation \n\n1. Reduce calories in your diet, depending on your weight to 1700-2000 to achieve a caloric deficit. 60% protein 30% fats (mono,poly,sat fats) 20% carbs preferably from fruit, veg, rice, quinoa, cut out bread, sugar, salty snacks, pasta.\n2. Increase cardio, turn up the intensity on your workouts so you are sweating, and burning calories.\n3.Switch it up, when your body gets used to a routine you plateau, so shock it by switching it up.\n\n\n(take omega 3-6-9 supplements every day! if you are in school, it will help maintain cognitive function, a diet can really slow your mind) "

  "text": "Did you know there are people out there who can walk faster than I can run? Lol cardio doesn't start and end at running, you can always dance (Zumba), jump rope, do stairs, speed walk, anything to get your heart beat up and burn carbs.  Cardio is mandatory - after a couple weeks of cardio *every* day you won't even need motivation.\n\nThen diet... Aah the most difficult thing to manage lol.  What I do is purchase Wasa crackers/bread packs that are reasonably priced (2 for 5$) and use good quality peanut butter on them (around 3$) and it will last my munchies AND lunch for a couple weeks.  Then you can get pita bread and hummus, some rice or quinoa, which can stretch the budget a bit but it is really high protein! Oh! and stock up on yogurt when it's on sale!  Yogurt saves my life when I get sweet cravings!  Then there's also those 5 calorie snack pack jellos that help in sweet cravings!\n\nTHEN while you do all of this you should also focus on becoming toned, so go on YouTube and find Pilates or yoga videos that will help you enhance your muscles.  Plus the more muscle you have the more calories you burn'\n\nI honestly can't give you a routine because everyone is different and I'm no trainer but I can say do about 30-40 min cardio, and pilates/yoga till you die and eat right, then repeat the next day - no days off.  This is what I do and it's workin' for me!"

 {
  "text": "That's actually pretty darn good, a lot is genetics and body type, your body probably likes to store fat there, i have seen power lifters with high % body fat but still have prominent abs, and it's because they store fat in other places. Typically it's side of the hips, lower back/ass, and stomach, you just have to really focus on that cardio and diet, and if you already have decent abs they will start to show fast.. Don't be discouraged if you don't see results right away, you tend to burn the fat around your organs first before it's starts to eat up the outside. \n\nA good trick i learned to double the burning of calories, take about half a tsp of cold pressed coconut oil and mix it in with a black coffee right when you wake up, don't eat breakfast, then do your intense cardio, the coconut oil delivers triglycerides into the blood stream and gets your body burning fats for energy right away. \n\nI eat 6 small meals a day, once every 2 hours, having the protein mostly at breakfast, lunch, dinner.. being lean proteins like chicken, fish, eggs. Almonds are great too, because they contain healthy fats, avocados to. Just remember not to starve yourself, eat fresh vegetables and fruit, and eat until satisfied, but not stuffed, don't eat passed 9. \n\nhaha it's a lot to take in man, but honestly once you get the routine down, it feels far better, you have more energy because your not digesting huge meals.\n\n  "

So if you workout 2 days a week, the food you eat in the other 5 days will be used for that. If you workout 6 days a week, everyday you use more calories from the food you eat for executing the exercises, so your body has less nutrients to grow. I suggest watching \"Ask Sean and Scott\", on YT. There are 5 episodes, where they answer questions and sometimes they go a bit off subject, touching some of the stuff you seem to be concerned about.

The best advice I can give you, is from my own experience: eat well, drink plenty of water and rest a lot (don't skip the eight hours of sleep/night). If you eat 5-6 times a day (smaller meals, take the three meals a day you'd  normally have and split them into six meals) your body will use the intake better and burn calories better. If you also reduce sweets, alcohol and sodas that should help a lot.

You need the rest of the time to rest and let your muscles recover and grow. I don't lift weights anymore (I do body weight stuff now), because of back problems, but I've tried a lot of routines over the past few years and what worked for me was: training each muscle group once a week with 3-4 exercises (3 sets per exercise). And once again, training is important (train HARD, but keep a GOOD form), but more important is eating and drinking water. The progress I made after I started eating well was amazing, I gained more muscle, a lot more strength and lifting the weights seemed kind of easier. I hope my experience helps you at least a little.

  "text": "Okay thanks. Right now I'm at 185 like I said. I go to the gym about 3 days a week on average. I'm about 14% body fat or so. My workout routine consists of usually:\nDay 1- Chest/triceps/biceps\n   -Flat Bar Bench, only one set of 10-12 of 195lbs because I don't always have a spotter\n   -Flat Dumbbell Press, 3-4 sets of 10-12 with 75-80 pound dumbbells\n   -Freeweight Pec Flys, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with 45-50 pound dumbbells\n   -Chest Cable Flys, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with 45 pounds resistance\n   -Pec Fly, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with 205lbs resistance\n   -(not every time) Decline Bench Press, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with about 205-215lbs\n   -(not every time) Incline Bench Press, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with about 175lbs\n   -Skullcrushers, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with about 70-80lbs\n   -Tricep Dips, 3-4 sets of 15-20\n   -Tricep Extension with cables, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with about 60lbs\n   -Hammer curls, 3-4 sets of 10-12 with 45 pound dumbbells\n   -Pull ups, 3-4 sets pf 10-15\n   -Curls with curling bar, 2-3 sets of 10-12 of 75-80lbs\n   -Curls on curling machine, 3-4 sets of 10-12 of about 55-60lbs with each hand\n   -Finish with full extension curls sitting down, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with 40lb dumbbells\n   -This is about an average workout. It changes sometimes, like I'll do drop sets and increase the weight after a set also depending on the day, but in general this is pretty good to go off of\n\nDay 2- Shoulders/Back/Biceps\n   -Incline Bench Press, again only one set because of lack of spotter usually, 175lbs\n   -Shoulder Press, again only one set because of lack of spotter, 125lbs\n   -Freeweight Incline Press, 3-4 sets of 10-12 with 60 pound dumbbells\n   -Freeweight Shoulder Press, 3-4 sets of 10-12 with 35-40 pound dumbbells\n   -Shrugs with bar, 3-4 sets with about 205\n   -Front raises with curling bar, 2-3 sets of 10-12 with about 80-90lbs\n   -Rows, 3-4 sets of 10-12 with 65 pound dumbbells\n   -Deltoid Fly, 2-3 sets of 8-10 with about 105 pounds\n   -Reverse Fly, 2-3 sets of 8-10 with about 135 pounds\n   -Again, this is just in general. It seems sort of structured, but these are really just general guidelines for my workout. I really need to tighten it up\n\nDay 3- Legs/Whatever Else\n  -Leg Press, 4-5 sets of 10-12, 400-420 pounds\n  -Variety of calf exercises that I don't know the name of, sorry, but there are a few.\n   -Whatever I think I missed before and need to hit more\n   -Legs I really need to step up on, I don't do enough with them. I sort of stopped after my back injury, but aside from squats and deadlifts, I should be able to do most leg exercises again. As you can see, my workouts need a little structure\n\nI run 2 miles, usually like 2 days a week.\n\nAverage diet consists of cereal or toast plus milk for breakfast. I've stopped all junk food breakfasts(e.g. donuts, too many bagels, etc.). Then lunch is almost always some sort of sandwich with usually fruit and milk. The sandwich could be ham and cheese, pb&amp;j, turkey and cheese, etc. Dinner is a wide variety, but usually includes a good amount of protein. I've started to avoid fast food now, but unhealthy foods still sneak in on occasion, which is going to stop. I'm starting a new lower calorie, higher protein intake diet. Before this, despite the fact that I was active, it wasn't enough to burn off all of the empty calories I was getting from soda and junk/snack foods etc. Soda's completely out now, as well as most junk foods. I'm going to adhere to this completely. I've done it before, so I'm not too worried about not being about to meet my expectations. \n"

  "text": "Well, your workout is really all over. I would simplify it.\n\nDay 1: Chest/Biceps\nDay 2: Back\nDay 3: Off\nDay 4: Shoulders / Triceps\nDay 5: Legs\nDay 6: Off\nDay 7: Off\n\nThe easiest way for me to recommend a training routine without providing an entire wall of text, is to reference Dorian Yates’ “Blood and Guts,” videos. He breaks down an excellent routine for bodybuilding. It also goes through the routine day-by-day, so you can watch it before your workout to get extra psyched. Here is a link: http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/dorian-yates-blood-guts-6-week-trainer.htm\n\nIn my opinion, you’re doing too much, and likely not giving enough to the really important exercises, as your energy has to be balanced out for such a long routine. Ideally you want to be in and out within 45 minutes, and for me, that can even include 10 minutes of cardio!\n\nI would start with Dorian’s 6 week trainer. You will see increases in size and strength. Follow it religiously. After 6 weeks, I always change-up my routine. At that stage, I’ll be glad to recommend a more customized routine for you, as you will be better able to gauge what is working for you, and what isn’t. \n\nAlso, when it comes to exercises – take your chest for example – typically you’ll want to do all the heavier / harder exercises first, the pushing movements, and then the fly movements. Your chest is taxed more from the pushing movements, and you’ll want to use the heaviest weights you can with them. In your current routine, after your do a flat DB Press, you go into flyes, but eventually back into presses. Your strength will be exhausted due to all the previous movements. However the presses are more important for muscle growth and then flyes, so you’re cutting yourself short energy/strength wise. It is better to tax your muscles completely through the pressing (heavier) movements, and then finish off your chest with fly-type exercises.\n\nRunning twice a week isn’t a problem; I do cardio 3 times a week even while bulking. I hate feeling winded when I don’t do cardio. \n\nYour diet is the biggest issue. For starters, you should try to eat 6 times a day. That is often impossible for people at the start. So aim for 4. Do that for 2 weeks, and then aim for 5. 2 weeks at 5, and then 6. If you weigh 185, and you want to gain weight, you need to know what your base caloric needs are, so you can see how much extra calories you will need to eat to gain weight. As I don’t know your daily activity level (i.e. at work, outside of the gym) I’ll say a baseline for keeping your weight as is, would be approximately 2600-3000 calories. \n\nYou should tally what an average day is calorie wise. Sure, calories will differ a bit between a PB&amp;J sandwich compared to a Ham &amp; Cheese, but overall, your daily intake will be somewhere within that range. This is important, as then you know how much more you need to eat.\n\nLet’s say you eat 2600 calories a day roughly. Well increasing your calories by 400 a day nets you an increase of 2800 calories at the end of the week. Keep that up over the span of a month and that is approximately 11200. See – now you’re gaining weight. Accompanying this weight gain with a proper workout routine as recommend above and your strength/muscles WILL grow.\n\nFor eating, what I do is if my goal is 3300 calories a day, I divide that by however many meals I’ll eat. For me that is 6. I include protein shakes / snacks as meals too. So 3300 / 6 = 550 calories per meal. If I know that I want my nutrients to be a 60/30/10 split (carbs/protein/fats), I can then start to piece together foods that will amount to those totals. I typically start with a protein, say a chicken breast, I’ll know its protein/calories, and then I’ll build around it. Say some trailmix for carbs and fats; or a sweet potato, etc. \n\nIt is annoying to write down everything you eat, but it does allow you to track and more effectively gauge your progress.\n\nFor diet, if you need some suggestions on what to eat, just ask."

Before this, I hadn't kept track of my workout routines either, so I suppose I'll just start keeping track of both at the same time. I'll definitely start concentrating my workouts more. When you say 60/30/10, is this like the optimal nutrient intake for gaining muscle? And I'm also guessing that the 10 is focused towards \"good\" fats, am I right? A few suggestions on meals would be great, I can figure them out myself once I have a decent idea of what to look for. Thanks a lot"

Free weights are superior in many ways, though you do run the risk of injuries if form isn't correct and such.\n\nAnd lastly, if you have experience with CrossFit, you should already have a solid understanding and foundation for many compound lifts, all of which are used to gain strength and mass.

  "text": "I'm technically a newbie also except that I've worked out for over 2 years(when I was 16) and basically just set goals of maxes for every 2-3 months. \n\nThe soreness dimishes as you work out more often and you just need to workout different muscle groups daily. \n\nHere's an example, I'm 6'3, 225lbs and 2 months ago I got back into going to the gym almost daily. I set a goal of dead lifting 3x 45's a side and I only got 2 weeks left, I'm already at 2x 45's + 1x 35 but can't quite do 3 full reps of 3x 45's. My routine has been arms/abs/deadlift on monday,legs/abs on tuesday, chest/abs/deadlift on wed, shoulders + light weight on increasing the smaller muscles around my knees/hips on thurs, and start all over again on thurs. \n\nFor my work outs, depending on the muscle group, I do different sets. The best for me is 8x3 but I generally mix it up. For my biceps, I do an upside pyramid, starting at 10 reps and go up in weight and down in reps. For my deadlifts, I'd do 8x3 w/ heavier weights and the next time I'd do 9x3, w/ heavier weights each time and the following deadlifts would be the upside down pyramid.\n\nMy next goal is benching 3x 45's a side but I've never had an easy time w/ bench pressing so it will probably take me 5 months.\n\nAnyways, there will be more experienced guys who will post but I thought I'd add my 2 cents to get you started. \n\nPs- getting \"jacked\" is over rated. Being strong like an ox on roids is cool. It's actually sad going into to gyms and seeing how big guys can get but can't lift all that much.\n"

Having an adequate amount in your diet can help you feel full longer, which it turns helps control your appetite. As for replacing meals, it really depends on what kind of protein you have. There are meal replacements available, set on the goal to losing weight, but most are taken in between meals, or after workouts. \nAnd for a bit of extra advice, instead of focusing on just all cardio, try throwing in some HIIT exercises as well. These are very effective in losing weight, but also keeping muscle. "

  "text": "Hi there, my name is Richie. If you are browsing the web looking for Rushfit review, you have come to the right place. I know this might sound too good to be true, but trust me, Rushfit workout progam is not a scam!\n\nHow do I know Rushfit is no scam? Let me share with you my own experience going into this workout program, founded by George St Pierre. He is an internationally known MMA superstar.\n\nWho Am I Exactly?\n\nI am active in wrestling since high school. My dad planted in my head that I am going to grow up being a champion wrestler even if it was only for state championship. So, being fit and keeping my body lean with weight training was like a routine to me.\n\nAfter high school, I went to college and discovered MMA. I found MMA an amazing sport and since I am so into martial arts. I thought to myself, why not give it a try. When I first started out in MMA, it was unbelievably hard. I had absolutely no idea my strength and stamina was not up for the sport.\n\nThat was when I started doing my research on home workout trainings that are available out there, I found the this workout program online. What got me so excited was that GSP RushFit was created by my MMA idol, George St Pierre. If you never heard of him, he has won many welterweights MMA championship since 2008. That is how good he is!\n\nWhat GSP Rushfit Workout Program Would Give You?\n\nIt comes with a DVD set containing 7 different workouts. Just like any other strength and conditioning training program, Rushfit has three different levels, starting from beginners, intermediate and advance level. My opinion between rushfit vs p90x vs insanity? I’ll definitely choose rushfit.\n\nWhat I like most about the program is how complete Rushfit are. It starts form strenght and endurance workout, explosive power training, fight conditioning workout, abdominal strenght and core conditioning as well as full body strength workout.\n\nThis program also has its own balance and agility training and most importantly for any MMA athlete, the strength for flexibility workout. Other than that, Rushfit also gives you a nutrition guides that will help you achieve your set goal in your home workout training.\n\nWhat I love about Rushfit workout is that it caters to each level of your strengh and body condition. If you are new at working out, the Rushfit suits you, too, because you can choose the intensity and there is no rush to finish all the routine. You do not even have to pace yourself since the ultimate goal of Rushfit workout is for you to let it all out, at the comfort of your home.\n\nI totally recommend you to join the Rushfit workout program, whether you want to improve as a MMA athlete or you just want your body to buff up and show it off to the ladies!\n\nFeel free to visit my site at www.HomeWorkoutTraining.com"

  "text": "If you are building muscle, you definitely need protein powder.  Remember that you can exercise all the time, however you have to watch your nutrition too.  Cutting carbs along with cardio will do much better than not cutting at all.  Just remember, when you cut carbs you may feel a little weaker than normal, this is fine.  It's your body getting used to a lower carb intake.  Also, Having cardio days often like that will cause your body to get used to it.  To keep things guessing add some HIIT like ChristianYAcevedo said.  I wouldn't do more than 3 days a week and add some weight lifting days in between.  Just remember no extreme lifting such as squats and heavy shoulder presses, It may hurt your spine.\n\nAs for my decision with your question, I would stray away from protein powder if you can.  Always try to eat your calories.  Drinking protein as a meal isn't as satisfying as eating something solid.  Like I said earlier, nutrition is key to losing weight.  Always cut out anything with bleached flour in it, like white bread, crackers, etc.  Replace them with whole grains.  But keep those at a minimum if you want a low carb diet.\n\nI don't want to write a novel, but hopefully this will help your decision. Good Luck!"

  "text": "First off, you have to know that change won't come overnight.  You will have what some people call \"beginner gains\", but they will taper off and your gains will slow.  It takes months and months of hard work to see the payoff.  \n\nSince you are new, I would recommend doing a pre-made workout.  This will set up a foundation for your future workouts by introducing you to moves you can use for different parts of your body.\nThe workout I recommend is here: [Shortcut to size](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/shortcut-to-size.html)\nThis site will explain all you need to know about form, nutrition (which I don't exactly follow, it's up to you) and supplements (also optional, other than protein).  You can even print out the workout book for free and use it.  The program is great, I have done it and got considerably stronger.  \nAnother thing, Try not to work out any longer than 1 hour- 1 hour 15 minutes,  Your body won't get as good of a workout and can even start breaking down muscle you already built.  Remember form is everything, quality over quantity, don't worry about the weight, just get the good reps (repetitions).  \nIf you have any more questions, let me know and I'll try to answer."

  "text": "There is such a thing as too much protein. If you supplement protein in your diet after awhile it reeks havoc on you liver and kidneys. You don't just pass the extra.\n\nAs for the OP, protein supplement won't hurt you at your age. A good whey protein and some multivitamins would be great. Optimum Nutrition is a good brand and they taste pretty good, banana is my favorite, just pay attention to the sugars/carbs as some flavors have more. I get their multivitamins too. If you are just running I wouldn't take more than one serving of the protein on the days you run after you get done. If you run at night get Casein protein because it's easier to digests while you sleep.\n\nYour diet is the most important part so eat good and get as much of your protein from that. Chicken and fish are the higher protein lower fat foods. Break your meals into smaller ones throughout the day. Fibers are really good for helping lose weight. There are different types of fiber and you should be adding those into your diet as well.\n\nI am not a nutritionist or a pro, this is just advice that has been given to me over the years. For the best advice you should join the forums on bodybuilding.com and take advantage of their special offers. I have yet to find supplements at a better price."

However, unless you work out with extremely high volume 4-5 times a week, you can get all your required protein just drinking a few glasses of milk a day.  \nSince you're only doing cardio, what your body needs is carbohydrate.

Your not doing a very high amount and I'm sure your muscles are doing fine keeping up (otherwise you wouldn't be able to do them). That being said, you shouldn't be feeling any pain in your pushups- perhaps you should take a day off in between and see if that fixes the tingles. If it doesn't, it's more likely a joint problem than a \"you working out too much\" problem. However, my shoulder used to pop pretty consistently with pushups and over time it stopped as I grew stronger. Hope this helps!"

It doesn't matter how far/fast/well you run, the most important thing to do it actually DOING it. After that I bought a basic pull up bar from Walmart and started doing that after I went running. Also, and I can't stress this enough, stay as far away from sodas and extremely salty foods. Every time you think about it drink water. Tons of water. It will actually cause you to lose a good bit of weight as your body purges the \"water weight\" held on by salts. (I'm sure I'm getting terminologies wrong, I'm self taught-sorry). I guarantee that just by watching what you eat and getting rid of salt/sodas you will lose 5 or more pounds within a couple weeks. Couple that with running and in a month or so and you will really start to see results. Good luck! (I went from 200 to 175 in about 5 months, but with a good bit of work)"

Dude, if you feel pain in your arms, you should take some time off, as it's often an indicator that something is seriously wrong and that injury or serious damage is looming... maybe you should take like a week or two off from doing biceps. Often, this will restore you, and you will feel totally invigorated and strong. in the meantime, you can still work your other body parts. I posted a blog that talks about injury, pain, and taking time off here... I think it's Rule #9... take a look, man.

It's a great way to lose weight but that's not what you're trying to achieve here.  15mins on the treadmill is all you need to get the blood flowing then get stuck into the weights.\n\n5) Finally, DIET\nNo choco bars, processed rubbish or fast foods - try to keep it clean and healthy but everyone's allowed the odd luxury ;)\n\nGood luck!"

  "text": "I'm no expert, but I've learned from experience:\n\n1) If you want to grow you should train each muscle group once a week (leaving the rest of the week for that muscle to recover and grow).  You need to do 3, 4 different exercises for each muscle group. Don't skip leg day!\n2) Eat right (muscles need to come from somewhere. That somewhere is food. You need to eat a lot). Drink plenty of water. \n\nThis should help: http://users.telenet.be/WBtE/cunning.html\n\n3) Sleep eight hours a night. That's when the growing happens. Also, being well rested you'll be able to train better.\n\nThat's what I've learned (from mistakes, mostly), but maybe someone will comment with more helpful information.\n"
 },
 {
  "text": "I'm no expert, but I think it's mostly about what you eat *and then* exercise. Specifically, how many calories you eat. In order to gain muscle mass, you need to consume calories in surplus of what you expend. In other words, you'd be better off looking at diets/etc. I can't help with numbers (i.e. how many calories you need to consume) b/c, well, I only know what works for me. The FAQ explains this a little more specifically than I can. Also, you may want to edit your post so that others can help you out more:\n\n1.) How long have you been doing this routine? \"A while\" for some people is a month, and for others its a few years. This will make a difference. And more than once a week is probably recommended. 3X a week should suffice, but, again, I'm no expert. Concentrate on the diet first, though.\n\n2.) What exactly are you doing? Again, the FAQ goes into this some more, but the number of repetitions and sets affects the gains you will see (assuming your diet is in order). We have no idea how long you spend at the gym? 15 min.? 30 min.? Sets/reps is better information than time, however.\n\n3.) There is something incongruous about your workout routine. While there's nothing wrong with working abs, when you say \"build a little more muscle,\" are you looking to reveal abs or bulk them? I'm assuming you want definition, which will require a loss of fat, which will require a diet with a caloric deficit, which will counteract any gains you want to see in your arms/chest. Again, I don't really know. This is only what I understand. Basically, I think you'll have to decide if you want to bulk or cut. I'm assuming bulk (and then you can cut slowly to reveal abs). Anyway, the other thing about your workout is your targets: shoulders and back are missing (I'm guessing you'd like to forget about legs). I'd suggest a more rounded-out workout routine.\n\n4.) This is the most important thing: height and weight. This is necessary information for the number-crunching. And it'll give us a better idea of what you're working with.\n\nAnyway, I've never been on your side of the spectrum. I'm trying to lose weight while converting as much fat to muscle as I can. So, please, if anyone here thinks I've misled you or left something out, feel free to correct me.\n\nEdit: Shit, I forgot that the FAQ I'm referring to is actually in /r/fitness. Read it, for sure. There's all sorts of helpful information in there, free calorie counters (which I'd recommend--I use myfitnesspal.com), etc. Many will say eat a lot--and a lot of protein--if you want to bulk, which is true, but you need to count calories to maximize your gains. For example, you may think you are eating a lot when in reality you are only eating enough (with exercise) to maintain your current weight. Gains will be hard to come by this way. I believe--don't hold me to this, though--that if you fill out a profile on myfitnesspal.com, you can select what weight you want to lose/gain each week (I'm unsure about the gain thing. I would hope that it's an option)."

The basic idea is that work your body more, see more gains (initially). Split routines are for those who have already accumulated significant muscle mass and for whom gains are difficult to come by (bodybuilders, etc.). While there's nothing wrong with a split routine (you will still see gains), it is more efficient to work out the body several times a week vs. working out the body over the course of two weeks, for example. Anyway, in the OP's situation, since he is only utilizing the gym 1-2 times a week and may not be able to use it more often, splitting a routine means that he may only work out his entire body once or twice a month.

If you can, get a medicine ball or box and alternate.  One hand on the box, one on the ground, then after one push up, switch without standing up.\n\nFor triceps, you can do a standard dip by putting your hands on a chair and your feet on another chair, or couch, then lowering and raising your body.\n\nIf you don't have weights, you can do curls with anything that has weight and will fit in your hand.\n\nBack is a little tougher.

You can also do rows with a heavy box or something of that type.\n\nThose are all good 'weightless' exercises you can do at home with little investment.  Just remember not to just do chest.  It's bad for you body and you'll end up looking lopsided."

It's hard for some people to dive right into the workout routine and stay motivated if he or she hasn't in a long time. If you are looking for just somewhere to start I say start simple. It isn't just working out, it's diet and mental health too. Start by just eliminating one bad thing from your diet coupled with taking the stairs whenever the opportunity presents itself. As gay as it might be just keep some sort of journal or record. After a week of that step it up to two bad things and a small workout routine. If you're really feeling bad about yourself you'll find what works for you. Good luck!"

It's the multidirectional instability that makes this much harder than dumbbell flies.

  "text": "As a swimmer, I'd recommend you do pushups for pecs and triceps. Do curls for biceps, french curls for triceps. Pushups can help build a great base for pecs, and after that benching helps build onto the muscle. For abs I recommend you do crunches, sit ups, and mason twists. Lots and lots of mason twists if you want toned abs. Don't just do pecs and abs though, work on your traps as well ( muscle between your neck and shoulders) do shoulder shrugs with a weight that your comfortable with but that is also challenging. For shits and giggles do some pull ups and see how many you can do every week or something, if you beat last week then reward yourself somehow. Lastly if you strictly only do pushups vary them, do diamond pushups to regular pushups to wide shouldered pushups to pushups where your feet are on a box so your feet are raised changing the degree intensifying the challenge. Don't do just one kind of work out every day, though it will work on one specific area, you want to train everything well instead of training one thing to look amazing. Imagine having on section of your abs in pristine condition yet the rest of your abs, and chest looks scrawny. Work everything and not just one thing.

But I can't exaggerate enough how important it is to rest. Make sure your body is rested before you repeat that day again (if you did push make sure you aren't sore at all when you do it again). You build muscle on your days off, when you're resting. Also protein is extremely important for building muscle. Its recommended to take 1 gram per pound if body weight per day, so for you take 150g of protein per day. Protein feeds your muscle, I usually take 3 shakes per day and various other meets for extra protein.\n"

When you're learning its good to focus on free weights and lifting with a bar, rather than machines.

You said your diet is \"set\" - please post your diet as often that is likely the easiest part to confuse and where most of your success will be made or lost.\n\nI'm here to help, so answer those questions and I'll do my best to shed some light on your situation."

  "text": "Hey John,\n\nThat helps a bunch. Without a gym membership you can still do a bunch. \n\nYou mentioned a bench press - do you have any dumbbells too? That would help with variety in exercises.\n\nPersonally when I started getting into shape, without hitting the gym, I began with this goal:\n\n100 Push-ups, 100 Sit-ups, 100 Body Squats, 50 Pull-ups\n\nThe end goal is to do this in sequence, 100 at a time through to 50 pull-ups. To train for that I recommend the following (adjust according to your current fitness level):\n\n25 x each exercise, except pull-ups with 10. This is a great full body routine that you can do every other day. You should take a rest between each day - focus on cardio on your off days. Not only will it help with your overall fitness, but also your endurance on the lacrosse field.\n\nTo Recap:\nMon / Wed / Fri:\n4 sets of 25 x Push-ups, Sit-ups, Body Squats; 10 x Pull-ups\nTues/Thurs:\n30 min on elliptical\nSat/Sun:\nOFF - enjoy your weekend, but EAT HEALTHY! \n\nI recommend doing your cardio in the morning, as soon as you can after waking up - before eating if possible. It sucks, it is daunting, however it helps spark your metabolism from the start of your day, and it is important to get yourself out to a proper start. Your body will appreciate it.\n\nLet me know about the dumbbells / barbell situation and I'll recommend some added exercises for weight lifting. Typically you can do the above routine in the morning, before or after a meal. You will want to do your weight lifting later, after you've eaten more and have more energy. \n\nGet back to me on that and we'll go from there, bud!\n\nOne thing: consistency is what will make the difference. If you can't do 25x right now, then do 12 and 13 and make more sets. Set goals and work toward them.\n\nIn about 6-8 weeks you'll notice a considerable difference in strength, endurance and muscle tone. Hopefully at that point you decide to spend some money on a gym membership and you can then really dive in!"

But the honest-to-God's truth is that this is what worked best for me when I started: http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/dorian-yates-blood-guts-6-week-trainer.htm\n\nNow, even if you don't want to be a huge bodybuilder, the principals of working out are all the same. It is just about deciding how you want your body to look and working toward that goal. \n\nThis routine will not only give you a solid foundation to work from, but as a natural athlete, you'll begin to learn about HIT - high intensity training. You'll be in and out of the gym in 45 minutes and seeing results. \n\nIf you have any other questions I'll be glad to answer them or make suggestions. However when it comes to a solid beginner routine, Dorian Yates can't steer you wrong!\n\nGood luck my man."

  "text": "First off, I just want to thank you for your sincere interest in this. I have dumbbells available. I have a couple questions and comments about the workouts. On an average night, I get 5-6 hours of sleep. As you can probably guess, this leaves me exhausted after adding school and lacrosse, so I do not see myself subtracting time. I usually have less than half an hour in the morning to prepare for school, and although I realize that the cardio will most likely not take long, I will most likely not be able to complete the workout without shortening my sleep time. I am still very interested in this workout plan, I am just curious if it would still be as beneficial in the evening. As I write, I am about to start set one of my new workout plan. Once again, thank you. \nJohn"
 },
 {
  "text": "Hey - no worries, my man! Glad to help!\n\nDefinitely do not sleep less! 6 hours should be your goal. As the one and only \"Arnold\" once said: There are 24 hours in a day, you sleep 6, that leaves 18 left for you to make something of yourself. \n\nSo instead of subtracting sleep, think about replacing some downtime watching t.v. or play video games. Depending upon the amount of space you have, even workout while watching t.v. (I do my cardio this way, watching World's Strong Men, motivates the fuck outta me!)\n\nI recommended the morning because as you develop your strength and conditioning, I would start adding in weighted exercises, but typically I do my weighted and body-weight exercises at separate times - this is why I mentioned AM/PM. Doing this in the PM will be fine too! In fact you'll likely have more energy in the PM to complete the full workout.\n\nSo just find whenever you can to do it. It shouldn't take more than 45 minutes to get started. \n\nOH - one other thing: You can vary up your grip on pull-ups, do chins, close grip, wide grip, alternating grip - whatever you can. This will likely be the hardest exercise to do and the most taxing, so don't get discouraged if you can't do 5 sets of 10.\n\nBecause I always liked pull-ups and thought it was impressive to see someone bang out like 20 pull-ups with ease, I really put a lot of energy at the start into them. It is a great exercise to build your body up. But my point is.. I also did pull-ups outside of my daily routine. Throughout the day. I would do this: Set 1: 10 Reps, Set 2: 9 Reps, Set 3: 8 Reps, all the way down to 1. Basically you are \"greasing the groove,\" getting your body familiar with the movement and stress of it, but not killing it like you would with repeated sets one after the other. If 10 is too hard, start at 5, then 4, 3, 2, 1. You'll get there. \n\nYou can also do the same for push-ups - quick sets throughout the day when you got a few minutes. Don't go to max. Just 25 or maybe 50 depending upon your energy levels. You'll be surprised how in a couple weeks those random 25-50 rep sets are a cakewalk. Don't bother doing this with sit-ups - you only need to work your core so much, and with lacrosse etc. I'm sure you're hitting it too. "

There are plenty of exercises that don't require equipment that are great for toning. You only need the equipment if you want to bulk. Just start going for runs regularly, do push ups and crunches and squats. The whole nine yards. Really what makes workouts effective is you pushing yourself to be better. I obviously I'm not the best person to answer because I am only 17. But that's what I use to do. Now I want to get bigger so I actually go to the gym XD"

Keep extending at a rate you feel comfortable with and keep the sets up for your cardio. \nWhatever your at after about 3-5 weeks if you've kept it up you should be at a stage where you should start doing free weights.

  "text": "Hey Midn1ght,\n\nI'd be glad to offer some advice. However before I can make some suggestions, I need a little back story about yourself. \n\nWhat do you aspire to look like, physique-wise? Do you have a photo or a name to reference? It can help me visualize what you're trying to achieve, as looking like Brad Pitt in Fight Club is entirely different than trying to look like Phil Heath, the current Mr. Olympia. \n\nSecondly, do you have access to a gym? Be it at home, school, or just in your neighbourhood?\n\nThirdly, you mentioned you eat at least 1500 calories plus two protein shakes - however two protein shakes are also calories, so are they counted in the 1500? If not, then you're actually closer to 1900. But then again - how are you estimating your caloric intake? Can you wirte down what you ate for the past week? Just roughly, i.e.\n\nMonday -3 eggs, 2 slices of toast, 1 protein shake, some chicken and rice later... etc. \n\nIf you are on a limited budget, I can help you plan a proper grocery list to maximize your dollars and get the most food. You just need to let me know what your budget is per week / month. Food allergies / stuff you hate/love would be helpful too.\n\nA couple immediate things I would stop: There is no need to do 200 crunches a day. Nor 300 push-ups. If you are planning to do calisthetnic / bodyweight exercises, you should split your body into an upper and lower body routine that you can alternate. I.e. Mon - Upper, Tues - Lower, Wed - Upper. However if you want to bulk up, you would be better suited to hit the weights!\n\nI'll look out for your reply. Hopefully we can get you on a program to building muscle and feeling better about your efforts!\n\nCheers,\n\nBryan from Friendly Fitness"

  "text": "Hey IReddit,\n\nGreat job on getting motivated to start working out! It will pay dividends in the long run, trust me!\n\nWhen it comes to developing a bodyweight or calisthenics routine, I would recommend splitting your body into 2 parts: Upper and Lower. You should allow your body to rest and repair itself between each day, so by switching portions of your body out, you can keep working on the fresh body part while the others rest. Recovery is crucial to any muscle development!\n\nI would recommend trying a split like this:\nMon:\nPush-ups 4 x 25\nWide-Grip Pull-ups 4 x Failure\nCrunches 4 x 25\nHanging Leg Raises 4 x 25 \n\nTues:\nBody Squats 4 x 30\nWalking Lunges 4 x 30\n\nWed:\nDecline Push-ups 4 x 25\nChin-ups 4 x Failure\nCrunches 4 x 25\nHanging Leg Raises 4 x 25\n\nThurs:\nBody Squats 4 x 30\nWalking Lunges 4 x 30\n\nFri:\nPush-ups 4 x 25 (last set to Failure)\nWide-Grip Pull-ups 4 x Failure\nCrunches 4 x 25 (last set to Failure)\nHanging Leg Raises 4 x 25  (last set to Failure)\n\nSat and Sun:\nREST\n\nThis routine will help you develop a sense of how to perform certain motions as well as build a solid foundation. Push-ups and Pull-ups are the two best bodyweight exercises you can do. I recommend varying the hand positions as it will help hit the muscles from different angles and really work the muscle. On Friday's  as you have the weekend to recover, I would push myself on the last set of each exercise - aim for 26, 27 - it doesn't matter how many more, or even if you get less than 25 - just put all of your intensity into this set, so when you're done you felt like you gave it your all.\n\nUse the weekend to recover. Your body needs rest and nutrients to repair the damage done over the week. Repeat the following week. If you can write down the # of reps you achieved on the Failure Sets on Friday. Make a personal goal to beat that # by 1 each time. Within a month you'll have made serious gains.\n\nHowever ALL of this won't truly work unless you FEED your body. That is just, if not more, important than the actual workout. Your body is a machine. Feed it properly to ensure that the stress you put on it won't be too taxing. \n\nIf you are planning to hit the gym and would like help on a weight-lifting routine, just let me know~"

FIND a way to increase the weight. go to a gym, strap something heavy on you, whatever it takes. your body gets condition and used to push ups for instance and you aren't really working it out.\n\nthese are very simple principles and will get results. some others will post more details i am sure and they are probably right. but as a rule of thumb, at 19, eat eat eat eat eat and increase the weight as much as possible while being safe. isolate muscle groups for different workout days too."

  "text": "Do not try to eat 5000 calories a day. You will just gain excess fat. You can calculate your daily caloric maintenance level and then add 250 calories a day to your diet. That's 1750 calories surplus a week. In two weeks that is almost a pound. You do not want to try and gain more than 1 lbs a week. Otherwise it will be lots of fat. Your diet should be constantly increasing as you adjust to eating more food. But you should never go over about 3000 cal a day. Especially at your current weight. Most professional bodybuilders will eat around 3000-3500 a day and they are at least 70+ pounds more than you."

  "text": "Do some forearm exercises too! Isolating weights and lifting about the wrist will really improve this (forearm flexion/extension; make sure to get both sides of forearms). Are all of these occurring on the same day as well? And how often a week? Your forearms shouldn't be getting smaller (as you're still using them somewhat with your body weight exercises), but maybe it seems that way with the growth in other areas? I really recommend the transition to a more free weight oriented program where progression can easily be monitored and enforced. You should be increasing weight by 10 lbs (dropping reps if you have to) every two weeks to maximize gains and avoid a plateau (search: Overload/supercompensation). Also I recommend trying to to isolate individual muscles more; it will really help with your gains. This is mainly my opinion and there are many ways to achieve the results you're looking for (depending on what those are). That being said you can definitely still incorporate body weight exercises (pushups/pullups) into your workout routine should you choose to begin focusing on free weights. Work your lower body too!

You would benefit from including weights and working out individual muscles  (I.e. separate exercises for separate muscles; biceps curl for bicep, tri extension, military press for shoulders, bench press for pecs, forearm wrist curls, lat. pull downs). If you're noticing gains in your upper body without any in your forearms, I don't think you're new additions will combat that. You should isolate them. If you can do a separate upper and lower body workout 2/3x each that would be best. What is it specifically you're looking for out of your workout routine?"

If you don't have a good diet of real food, the supplements won't do anything.\n\nIf you are trying to gain size, make sure you are getting enough calories with enough carbs and protein throughout the day from good sources (lean meats, healthy carbs, good fats etc...).  You can look up good diets online, but just to get you started \n\ngood proteins - fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs\n\ngood carbs - sweet potatoes, brown rice, oatmeal\n\ngood fats - flax seed oil, nuts, extra virgin olive oil\n\n\nPost workout it's important that you don't just get protein in, you also need some fast digesting sugary carbs mixed in with that protein.  Add dextrose corn sugar to the whey protein or drink chocolate milk.\n\nIt sounds like you are a total beginner, if that is the case, supplements are the least important thing for you.  A good diet of healthy whole foods, proper exercise form and a consistent training schedule are 100x more important than supplements.\n\nOh and one more thing, if you are going to be taking creatine MAKE SURE you are drinking a lot of water.  Taking creatine and being dehydrated is not only counter productive but can be very unhealthy for your kidneys and probably other bodily systems too.  Creatine works with water, you should be drinking a lot of water anyways, but when taking creatine it's even more important.  \n\nAlso get a good multi vitamin and some flax seed oil for your omega-fats."

  "text": "A couple months ago I started working out with a close friend of mine who was fairly new to working out at a gym. Right before my set a guy walked up to us and asked if one of us could spot him so I looked at my friend and told him to go spot him. They guy was doing dumbbell press on a flat bench and my friend had no idea how to spot him properly, just that he needs to be there in case shit goes down. The guy gets the weights up on his own and lays down on the bench. Instead of kneeling down behind him to push his elbows and spot him, he kind of crouched to the side and hovered over the guy on the bench. I think this was the guys last set and he was maxed out so he needed help. He yelled to my friend \"Get it! Get it!\" So my friend kind of stands up and puts his hands on the dumbbells right above the guys hands and tries to pull them off. At this point the guy is really confused, mad, and cant hold up the dumbbells anymore so he ends up tossing them as my friend runs off to the side to avoid getting hit by the dumbbells. I ended up taking over and showed him how to properly spot someone!"

  "text": "I would definitely try compound movements such as squats, bench press, deadlifts, and rows. All can be done with the barbell. Make sure whatever gym you sign up to has a power rack or at least a squat rack. Do not use a smiths machine as this does more damage than good as it only allows you to move in one straight line and therefore you don't work any of your balance muscles. I would go three times a week, mon, wed, Fri, and rest in the days in between. Start with an empty bar and do five sets of five reps. Check out stronglifts 5x5 workout on youtube. Its the one i use at the moment. (no affiliation, its just the one that works for me) its a great work out and will make you nice and strong. Make sure you get your diet in check. Plenty of protein, vegetables, and healthy fats. Stay away from white carbs as they will mess you up.( look up paleo diet, or Tim ferriss's slow carb diet). Also, at the beginning you want to focus more on building the 'habit' of going to the gym and not go full out and get demotivated. In the beginning, always leave wanting to do more. Like, even if you go for 10 minutes 3 times a week for 2 weeks, then up it to 15 minutes for the next 2 weeks ect. The point being, that once you work it up to a full exercise session, the habit will have been formed so strong, that you wont be able to not go to the gym. Hope this helps!"

  "text": "Hey, congratulations on making the choice to start working out! It will be tough to get motivation at first, but in the end you will fall in love and it will be very rewarding. \n\nStarting off, you'll want to do a lot of compound movements. Since you're only gonna be working out 2-3 days a week, this is the best option. Workouts like squats, deadlifts, bench press will work many muscles. Also do some body weight exercises. Push-ups, pull-ups and dips (with weighted assist if you need it). These body weight exercises will engage your core and make you stronger overall. Small windows of cardio between lifts (for 30-60 seconds for example) will accelerate your heart rate and burn fat. \n\nMake sure you keep good form in all your workouts. Don't let your knees come out over your toes on squats, keep your elbows closer rather than flared out during bench press, and always warm up, especially your shoulders. Nothing is worse than injuring yourself and being sidelined for weeks. \n\nWorking out is great, but if you want those show-off muscles, it's 80% nutrition. Eating right will skyrocket and speed up your results by miles. \n\nCheck out bodybuilding.com and look up Jim Stoppani. He has a doctorate in Exercise Physiology and is incredibly knowledgable. \n\nHope I helped, if you need anymore specifics, like exact workouts to do or how many calories to eat for your specific goal then let me know! Glad to help. Good luck! \n\nEdit: didn't really read the part about using body weight only. All those exercises can be done with body weight only, but as you get stronger you'll need some extra weight. Maybe consider grabbing a weight jacket from Walmart. Also, workouts like Insanity and P90X use body weight (mostly) and are great for seeing quick results. If you're interested in these send me a PM and I can point you in the right direction. "

 },

  "text": "Sure, I'd be happy to elaborate. \n\nBench press - works chest, triceps (back of your arms), and shoulders slightly. The closer together your hands are, the more it works triceps. The farther apart your hands are, the more it works chest. The entire action will work the stability of your shoulders so its always best to warm up shoulders before doing bench press. Push-ups will also work these muscles, and engage your core/abs more. Make sure to keep your elbows closer to your body. It's natural to want to flare your arms out during bench press, but this will put too much stress on your shoulders and can injure you. \n\nDeadlifts - works lower back, engages your core/abs, and can also work hamstrings/glutes (butt) depending upon how straight your legs are. Keep your back arched here, and don't let your knees stray out over your toes. A non-arched back can quickly cause back injury and make you have a sore back for weeks. \n\nSquats - works all parts of your legs (hamstrings, quads) and glutes. Also can put some strain on your back, so its important to keep correct form. Keep most of the weight on your heels, NOT YOUR TOES. Keeping the weight over your toes will put stress on your knees. Imagine sitting back in a chair as you take the weight down. Arched back here as well. Use a smith machine (the rack with the bar that is attached and slides up and down) since you are new. \n\nPull-ups - works back muscles and biceps slightly. Very tough at first, but great for building strength. \n\nDips - triceps, chest, shoulder stability. Chest up works your triceps more, leaning over with your chest facing the floor works your chest more. \n\nLeg lifts will help work those tough to get lower abs. \n\nAgain, if you want to see max results, eating right is key. This website will help calculate calories you need to gain/lose weight, depending on what you want. \n\nhttp://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm\n\nAlso, since you're 15, you're still growing so you don't want to hurt yourself and stunt your growth. Keeping the weight lighter will help you grow without hurting your bones/joints. Stay with lighter weights and switch up your reps from 10 to 15 to 20 on different weeks. I wouldn't recommend using any weight that you can't lift more than 10 times. After a few weeks you should see major improvement in strength. Eating right will help you see visual improvements quicker. \n\nAlso, stretch the muscles you just worked after your workout! Stretching will improve your recovery time and even help a young body like yours grow taller and stronger. \n\nhttp://www.bodybuilding.com/ has tons and tons of articles on proper nutrition and lots of workout samples.

  "text": "I've had femoral nerve problems for a while. They aren't specific to working out my legs, but I will let you know what I have learned from trying to deal with it. Keep in mind this is my experience only, but I think it could help.\n\n The nerve that it sounds like runs around the top of the thigh and the sheath that protects it runs into the hip. If that sheath is damaged in some way, you get that tingle, sometimes pain, sometimes just flat out numbness. The how and why it gets damaged depends on the person, I've been told, but your symptoms sound close to mine enough that it may be what I have, just being pinched in the hip. \n\nFor example, if I cross my legs, my thigh goes to sleep almost instantly. At first it bothered me, but I've gotten used to it. Now think about working legs...lot of bending at the hip, etc. It's possible that you're pinching the sheath and that's what's causing it. \n\nSo, how can you be sure. The way I was tested was they ran an electric current into my hip and measured the response. Two things: it hurts like a motherfucker and second, seriously, it fucking HURTS. And at the end of it, I was given a choice of them opening up my hip and leg and repairing (maybe) the sheath, or deal with it. Since you didn't say anything about loss of power or movement, I'll assume it's like mine and there isn't any. That was the deciding factor for me; it wasn't really affecting me that much (I was used to it by that point), so I've let it be. I have read that serious cases can limit movement, so if that's the case, get to the doctor.\n\nAgain, all of this is just my experience, not medical advice, but I hope it helped. And honestly, the worst part is feeling like my phone is vibrating in my pocket, when it's on the counter. I wouldn't overly worry but if you get weakness or mobility issues, see your doctor and it's probably worth mentioning anyway.\n\nTL;DR: Your nerve sheath may be getting pinched; if you have limited strength or motion, see someone with MD after their name."

  "text": "Train in intervals. Not necessarily high-intensity interval training (HIIT) but rather run/walk, jog/walk on a treadmill or fluctuate between medium/low resistance on the elliptical. Start doing 50% medium intensity with 50% low intensity and each day try to work a little harder. For example, day 1: 50% medium and 50% low; day 2: 55% medium and 45% low; day 3: 60% medium and 60% low. Try experimenting with doing some high intensity work mixed with medium intensity followed by low and so on; do what feel right for you. You just want to challenge yourself and at the end of each session, you should feel like you've made progress. If not, work a little harder the next day. \n\nAs for strength training, what I find works the best for me is to take a look at some workout plans and adjust to my liking. I like to pick from men's health (women's health, in your case) and the \"find a plan\"  tab on www.bodybuilding.com. These are only a few resources but there's really no limits. Figuring out what results you're looking to attain and in what time period you would like to see them is the easiest way to build these workout plans. Make it work for you.\n\nFinally, SET A GOAL for yourself, write it down and keep track of your workouts, weight, heart rate, etc. in a notebook. You'll be impressed with the progress you've made after only a short time if you stick to it. \n\nHere's a plan from Women's Health: http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/6-weeks-to-bootcamp-fit-week-1-circuit-workout\n\nHere's a sample plan:\nCardio 50/50 high/low intensity for 20 minutes (2 min high, 2 min low, etc.)\n\nUpper body (perform as a circuit with a weight that is challenging to lift 10 times):\n1) Bench press with barbell or dumbbells (10 reps)\n2) Shoulder press with barbell or dumbbells (10 reps)\n3) Bent over row (10 reps)\n4) Alternating arm raises with dumbell (10 reps)\nLower Body (again, as a circuit with a challenging weight or simply body weight)\n1) Squats [body weight or with weight] (10 reps)\n2) Lunges (10 reps per leg)\n3) Jump Squats (10 reps)\n4) Split Jumps (10 reps)\n\nYou can mix the order so that you're doing an upper body exercise followed by a lower, just as long as you feel challenged.

I would first start working on your diet.  You are 18 years old, so your metabolism is in your favor.  I would recommend switching to a clean diet, eliminating all processed food &amp; sugars.  Stick to eggs, meat, veggies, and don't crazy on fruits.  For fruits, I would stick to berries.  But, like I said, don't go crazy with the fruits.  Look online for a workout routine.  I would recommend starting strength by Mark Rippetoe.  I know you said you don't want to pack on muscle, but you will burn plenty of fat lifting.  I would buy Starting Strength 3rd Edition, and start reading it immediately.  While you are waiting for that to get delivered from Amazon, start doing calisthenics.  Do push ups, body squats, pull ups, crunches, jumping jacks, and jump rope.  And stretch after exercising.  Throw in sprints twice a week.  When the book arrives, start lifting the Starting Strength Novice Routine.  I hope this helps, good luck!!"

  "text": "First, congratulations on your achievement!  \n  \nFor a subreddit dedicated to \"couck to 5K\", check out /r/c25k  \nSo, you want to make working out a habit. What forms a habit? Enjoyment does! Find something fun to do that will challenge your body. Mix it up, play with it. The reason I'm a workout addict is because I'm always finding something new to do, a new goal to achieve, and I'm always playful about it. Maybe I'm not the next big powerlifter, or bodybuilder, or athlete in some sport, but one thing is certain: I never feel burned out or sick of working out.  \nRight now, I'm learning to hold a handstand and do handstand pushups. It's a lot of fun! :)  \n  \nGood luck on your never ending journey to peak fitness!"

  "text": "First, don't forget your legs.  \n  \nTo increase upper body muscle mass, you probably want to focus on lats, traps, chest and shoulders. My own main focus is on these, but not chest.  \nI recommend you do horizontal and vertical pushing and pulling for structural balance. Pullups are vertical pulls, rowing is horizontal pulling. Dips and overhead presses for the pressing motions. Basically, most upper body muscle mass is centered around the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. If you do an exercise that moves your shoulders forward, back, up and down, under load, this should work nicely.  \nIf you don't have weights available you can still do these, with the exception of overhead presses. You can try working up to handstand pushups to substitute.  \nCompound (using several muscle groups in unison) exercises are the best at packing on muscle fast. You should definitely do some deadlifts eventually to build your back."

First thing in the morning drink \n1-2 glasses of water, focus on eating fruit and vegs, you want to eat often(7-8 times aday) but not much(this is to increase your methabolism), never eat yourself compleatly full, only eat until you are not hungry anymore no more. Then you need to drop all sugar from your diet. You see the fat is lost in the kitchen while the muscels are gained in the gym. Hope this helps! And sorry about bad english"

Myself before I joined the Army, I pretty much drank and smoked as many cigarettes as possible so my first few days of basic training were awful, albeit they will probably be awful anyways, but that is the joy of learning the military's ways.  \n\nYou can build up.  Studies show it takes about 48 hours for muscles to recover, so if you do push up and sit up drills every other day at roughly the same time, you will see a pretty drastic increase in performance as long as you continue to push yourself through the workout.\n\nRunning is a different beast.  Make sure you get a good pair of shoes to run in.  Talk to a running shoe shop locally if you can and have them critique your running style.  I run forefoot striking first like I'm up on my toes because that is what is comfortable for me, but everyone is different.  I also use minimalist style shoes.  My personal experience with the shoes was different than a lot of people.  I took my 2 mile run from an average of 14:30 to sub 13:00 after training in those bad boys for about a month.  I like them, but like I said, find one that works for you.\n\nI recommend looking into interval training if you want to cut down on time.  \n\nDitto to lennarn though, don't overdo it at first, it is most definitely possible to do 100 pushups and 100 situps in 2 min, consistency and intensity seem to be the best remedy for this situation.\n\nAlso don't ignore nutrition, give your body healthy foods and it will thank you."

Jogging burns maybe a 1/4 of the calories you intake per day.  Eating a lot (unhealthy food) negates the calories you burned on that day since you're taking more calories.  Be wary of the things you eat and serve your food on a smaller plate. What I would do if I were you is do 8 sets, yes 8, of 4 workout routines per day.  Do 4 sets of each (15, 12, 8, &amp; 6) and then run on a treadmill (running is basically your break), then do the last 4 sets after running.  "

Here's my workout. \n\n30 min on treadmill before and 30 min after every day. \n\nMonday: Chest, biceps\n\nDB Bench press 3 x 6 \nDB Incline press 2 x 10\nVertical bench press machine 1 x 20 \n\nBB curls wide 3 x 6 \nDumbbell curls 2 x 10 \nBB curls close 1 x 20 \n\nTuesday: Legs\n\nSquats 3 x 6 \nLeg press 2 x 10 \nHack squats 1 x 20 \n\nWednesday: Core Abs\n\nAb machine 3 sets 6 reps\nObliques 2 sets 10 reps\nCrunches 1 set to failure\n\nThursday: Shoulders, triceps\n\nMilitary Press 3 x 6 \nFront laterals 2 x 10 \nShoulder Press machine 1 x 20 \n\n1 arm DB Skullcrushers 3 x 6 \nOverhead triceps 2 x 10 \nTriceps pulldown 1 x 20 \nTricep push down or dips 1 x 20 \n\nFriday: Back, calves\n\nFront lat pulldown 3 x 6 \nSeated cable rows 2 x 10 \nBent over rows 1 x 20 \nDead lifts 2 x 10 \n\nStanding calf raises 3 x 6 \nSeated calf raises 2 x 10 \nCalf raises on leg press 1 x 20 \n\nIt works great for me I also just started counting calories. I eat what I want I just make sure to stay under 2000 cals. I also cut out all my sodas.  I'm down to 201 as of this morning. My DB bench press started with 25s and now I use 65s.  My Bb curl started with 40 now I do 90. I can go on but for the most part my lift weight has double from where I started. Except legs mainly cuz I hate leg day. \n\nI'm still learning myself but this has worked great for me. I've done a lot of research and there's a lot of contradicting information out there. \n\nThe reason for the different rep counts is that your muscles are made of 3 different fibers and this kind of hits them all and for the most part hits all your major muscles. \n"

Write down your weight for each exercise and keep the same routine for at least a month or until you plateau I still haven't plateaued in 3 months with this one. I have a friend that just does random exercises for each day. He works out the sane muscle group each day of the week but different exercises and never writes anything down. He's lost about 5 lbs and has increased his weight by about 10 lbs. he's been working out for about 8 months he's the one who got me started and is now upset cuz I've had better results. "

Kinda my own fault for breaking them during a soccer game then finishing my season out after taking a few games off.\n\n My advice would be low impact cardio and try really hard to control your breathing. I had an elastic strap tight around my chest just to keep myself from breathing too deeply. The breathing just kills ya. So really the main thing you have is biking or walking. You can try to do some weightlifting but It's probably not a good idea."

  "text": "If you're just starting, first look at your nutrition. You're young and w/ the proper diet you could make some significant improvements. Fatty nuts and whole grains are great for energy pre workout, and don't forget your chocolate milk to reward a good routine.  It sounds like you've already started on some form of a circuit routine. These are nice for toning and endurance, but they're not a fast track to building strength. However you're not going to injure yourself doing body weight circuits so they are a great place to start. Think about incorporating some leg work into your circuits ie: alternating lunges, jump squats, maybe some burpees for burn out purposes. Go to youtube and look at variations for pushups, squats, core work etc. There is a million ways to work your body and changing it up keeps you interested, prevents injury, and accelerates growth. Consider some inverted rows also. They are easier then pullups and work your core as well. Also, if you're not a fan of distance running consider finding a comfortable 1/4 or 1/8 mile pace and doing circuit work between your sets. Establishing a shorter consistent pace is the best way to improve your mile time. It's similar to how you lift. You don't bench 40 reps, you take it in sets of 10. There's a ton of other pointers to take in, but always the most important thing is to have heart and keep at it.  Remember you do it for yourself and any workout is a gain both mentally and physically."

Intervals work super well (as long as you're very intense), you could do it for reps, for time, an amrap (as many reps as possible), a pyramid, etc. the possibilities are endless! \n\n\nHowever if you're trying to bulk or gain strength, I can't help you there...

I guarantee if op actually sits down and tracks his intake he will find the same thing. \n\nEdit: I don't mean to say vitamins and supplements are a waste.  I am sure there is some value in them.

A well balanced diet can make or break your results. Unless you have a very high metabolism, then it won't make much of a difference. During the trimming period, do a lot of high repetition, body weight workouts (lunges, single leg squats, wall sits, dips, push-ups, crunches, super mans, etc.) Once you have reached a good level of fitness, take your weights and do all of the same body weight workouts. This will boost toning and will improve strength as well. Be sure to do high reps with low weights. You can PM me and I could put together a workout plan, if you want :)"

For instance running on the treadmill at 7.5 for a minute and then 3.5 for 30 seconds and back and forth until your workout is over. When your heart rate rises to the ideal level you begin to burn fat. But when you keep it there too long you stop burning fat and begin to burn protein, muscle, etc. By running in intervals you ideally bring your heart rate down to avoid burning muscle and then back up to burn fat. I know that was a shotty explanation butthe eagles are on and thats simply more important"

  "text": "Overall, it's not a waste of time depending on your goals. \n\nThere is something called nutrient timing, which helps our bodies recover faster and spend less time in a catabolic state. Essentially, you snack right after exercise and eat a meal 2-3 hours later. By not eating, your body stays in the catabolic state a normal amount of time (6 hours if I'm not mistake). I'm unaware how sleeping would affect this.\n\nAlso, testosterone is typically at its highest levels during nighttime, which allows for some sick lifts when compared to am lifting. Hope this helps."

Your insurance will not pay for a prescription medication when you could take something over the counter, and you usually need to fail 30 days of an over the counter med before your insurance will pay for something else (US of course, not sure about other countries). \n\nLong term wise of uncontrolled reflux is scaring of the esophagus which can even lead to cancer down the road, so get it controlled now. \n\nAll of these drugs will limit to some degree your absorption.

I didn't feel more energized or like I was gaining more muscle. Whey protein absorbs in under 30 minutes if you take it within an hour after working out and will significantly increase your lean muscle mass which in turn helps your metabolism burn more fat. More muscle = more fat burn even when resting. \n\nAlso take a multivitamin. It's crazy how much these will help with energy and recover. Alive is the one I use as they include vegetables and fruit concentrate. \n\nHope this helps :)"

Snack in between lunch is a banana or grapefruit any type of fruit you like. Lunch is usually naan bread with hummus with chicken. Snack between lunch and dinner is vegetables like sugar snap peas, carrots or any other veg. Dinner is protein time, Turkey, lean beef, chicken with sweet potato and more veg also make sure it's spicy it can raise metabolism. My workout is a bit flexible but can help everyday, I use a old rowing machine for half an hour after that it's arm or core day. I do this 3 times a day. Morning, afternoon and night, with your schedule just figure out a way to get at least an hour at night if you want, again rowing for an hour can help a lot."

Most people who say toned are referring to that beach body style physique (well developed arms, visible abs, etc) so if that's the case then most likely no.  I suppose you could put on a couple pounds of muscle but not enough to change your physique radically.  When you're first starting out like you are the best way to make progress is to take advantage of your newbie gains.  Get a gym membership and start with something like a Starting Strength program.  Heavy compound lifts with little to no cardio.  Realistically you should be able to put on about 20 pounds of muscle in your first year with good nutrition and dedicated lifting."

It doesn't have to be drastic instead of fried chicken take the grilled chicken , or instead fried rice stick to white rice. ( home cooked meals are always a plus ) As for your workout routine you should never get comfortable doing the same exercise because eventually you body will adapt to the work out and you will begin to plateau. But the changes can be minor as well maybe do different variation of pull ups, push ups, etc. or super set two work outs. As long as you are consistently challenge yourself your muscles will grow. "

Generally I'd say you if you can't hit  8 reps in a set consistently then you're not ready for that weight. Once you can do 2 sets of 12 and 2 sets of 10 at a given weight you're probably ready to move up. This is advice that not be as relevant to you yet, but as you get older it will be.

I do these with a 25lb plate and they are amazing for lifting the booty. \n\n#5. Stiff leg Deadlift as heavy as you can. I saw results from these within 3 workouts. \n\n#6. Bulgarian Split squat. These are also amazing. Start light and make sure your form and balance are in check before going heavy. \n\n#7. Rear lunges. I like to do these on the smith machine only because there are always way to many people in my gym to walk backwards... \n\nAlso, I like walking lunges a lot better than stationary ones for my butt. Also remember to take a big step and get your knee all the way down. I also like to do cable kick backs, donkey kicks and fire hydrants. It was also helpful for me to start working on muscle control.

Also I would alternate between using the barbell and the dumbells on chest days. It's hard\nto explain why that is, but the gist is you'll see gains more often at the gym. But if you wanna choose just one stick with the dumbells as they'll build muscle that will help you push someone off of you in a fight BC it works your stabilizer muscles. "

  "text": "Hi!\nCongratulations on your new journey! And congratulations on the already phenomenal weight loss! 80 pounds ain't no joke!\nTo start: This sub is pretty dead, you would have a better time over at r/fitness. \nHowever, some advice I have for you:\n-Since you have quite a bit of weight to lose, it might be best to consult your doctor before beginning your journey to discuss any  possible medical precautions and for general advice on diet and nutrition. \n-Diet is key. You will not see the results you'd like without sticking to a major diet change. Perhaps a calorie counting app, such as myFitnessPal, would be a good starting point. Apps such as that let you log all food intake and give you daily calorie goals to meet depending on your stats. \n-Start slow. No need to jump into professional body building from the get-go. Work at a pace that will challenge you, but won't leave you completely gasping for air. Modify exercises as needed. Can't do standard crunches? Modify by trying a standing bicycle crunch!\n\nGranted, I am not a professional. But from my personal experience, these key ideas really help anyone trying to get in shape. \nGood luck!! :)"

  "text": "Soccer player here\nAs far as conditioning goes, you can do a lot with just the field. A really simple running workout is to divide the outside of the field into six sections (end line to midfield, midfield to end line, sideline to sideline, end line to midfield, etc.) and start by sprinting one section and jogging five, then sprinting two sections and jogging four, all the way until you are sprinting all six sections. This will get your stamina and sprint speed up while getting you used to actively resting (while jogging). The only strength exercise that I have done specifically for soccer is a push-up ladder that is kind of hard to explain but I'll do my best. Do one push-up, immediately followed by one shoulder press (no weight, just lift your arms over your head as if you are lifting two Dumbbells). Then do two push-ups and two shoulder pressed, and continue until you do ten push-ups followed by ten shoulder presses, then work your way back down to one. Both of these are designed so that you could do the exercises on a soccer pitch. If you do at least ten minutes of conditioning during your normal soccer training and try and run at least 5-6 times per week you should get a lot more fit, and try doing the push-up ladder as much as you can (or just work your way up to it-I had to try a few times before I could do the whole thing).

  "text": "First off, awesome for you to start working out and having the desire to get fit!  Running in place is a good start (but I'm sure pretty boring).  Jump rope would definitely give you the same cardiovascular benefits as well as give you a change of pace.  Plus, there are plenty of variations of jump rope to keep it  fresh (side to sides, front to backs, single leg hops, high knees, etc).  \n\nAs a beginner still, I would think you could work out 3 or 4 times a week.  I usually alternate between strength days and cardio days.  Switching your training days to this type of cycle will help with not feeling too sore to work out after a days rest.  Saving the push ups, squats, crunches, etc all for your strength days will still give you 2-3 days to recover from most of your muscle soreness.  Not to mention that cardiovascular activity actually helps reduce soreness inbetween your strength sessions (I always heard, and agree from experience, that steady cardio flushes out lactic acid build up - the body's byproduct of muscle metabolism that causes soreness in your muscles) .  \n\nAs far as push-ups not activating your chest muscles, I would be sure to retract your shoulder blades while you doing the movement (pulling your shoulder blades back trying to make them touch).  This would reduce the shoulder involvement during pushups and isolate your chest more.\n\nI hope this all helps and good luck!\n"

  "text": "Functional training! Functional training include lots of excercises from crossfit, body building and pilates, plus having mostly its own excercises. The difference is this: functional training is also functionaly oriented as the name says, while the others types try to achieve only one goal. In a lesson, you do cardio, bodybuilding and functionality excercises. Most of the time, you combine them in one excercise, and you work with time, not with reps. It makes you gain mass because you do a lots of reps in that range. It empowers you because some excercises are power-oriented (i.e. stand still in squat position) and there are the crossfits excercises like snatch and clean and jerk which improves explosive power. You improve resistance because you do as many reps as you can (and the more you ho further, the more complex excercises become), because of rope jumps, run and so on. You improve coordination because some excercises are as I say one way i.e. you have to perform them correctly following the instructions otherwise you just can't do them.\nOnce you're able of doing the basics, you can start mounting weights and so the excercises will turn more complex and harder.\nBesides gym, I advise you walk a lot during your routine. That gives you a little extra workout that in the long term shows really nice results. I used to be very thin, but thanks to this workout I'm well shaped and most of all I can do things in my life more easily.\n"

  "text": "The most important thing you should know is that losing fat is 20% working out and 80% nutrition and diet, which I see no mention of above. As long as you eat less than you burn you will lose fat. You can do this by burning more calories (by doing cardio/interval training, and/or by gaining muscle) or eating fewer calories.\n\nNote that crunches and ab workouts will not burn fat for you (well, a negligible amount) as they are not large enough muscles to really help with this, but will help to add definition for when your bf% is low enough to reveal abs. I'd include squats or another major leg workout in your routine in place of the ab work or as well as it, as leg muscles are your largest and will aid in burning more calories at rest for you.\n\nHope this helps!"

Since I hate eggs and chicken and don't like wasting money, either, why would I want to eat way more of that garbage than I have to?

Thank god there are more things you can eat besides chicken but that gets pricier. I like getting salmon and pork chops.  They have some fat which tastes good but not like steak which alot of the times can be really fatty. There tons of different ways of cooking chickens. i know ppl who love slow cookers. pan frying  boiling, i personally oven bake mine, bbqing ect.  Same thing for eggs. Add eggs to ramen, Add eggs to salads, add eggs to rice. Other good sources of protein would be in some veggies and beans. Broccoli beans etc.    \n\nNow is this overkill? maybe 150 seems like alot to you but i think you should try it and see how you feel after say 2 weeks then after 4 weeks. End of the day you know your body best but id say try it out and then adjust. try shooting for 120-145g\n\nTLDR Learn to prep season and cook."

  "text": "First of all, congratulations to your decision to get in shape. It shows that you're a smarter person than 17-year-old me was.\n\nThe biggest part of weight loss is done by making good choices about what you put into your mouth - or more cleverly put \"you can't outrun a bad diet\". While the human body is a complex machine, for weight loss purposes we can simplify it to a very simple calculation: You ingest (and drinks can be *very* calorie-dense, so it's not only what you eat) more energy (Calories) than you use, and your body stores the excess as fat. You ingest less energy than you use, your body burns stored fat since it has to get that energy from somewhere. To lose fat, you thus need to \n \n * Know how much energy you'll need. There are online calculators that only take a few inputs (age, height, weigth, activity level) and will give you a reasonable approximation. (Total Daily Energy Expenditure - TDEE calculators)\n\n * Based on your TDEE, set a calorie target. For example, if your TDEE was 2500 kcal, and you want to lose 1 pound of fat per week, your target would be 2000 kcal, as in a week you'd have a deficit of (500 Calories * 7 days) = 3500 Calories, which is the amount of energy in 1 pound of fat.\n\n * For everything you eat or drink, know its energy contents. As you go along your day, track everything. Thanks to the glorious smart phone this is way less tedious than it used to be. \n\n * Keep your actual ingestion near your target. (This is the part that can be a bit challenging. But you can do it. Source: I can do it, and I'm not special.)\n\n * Weigh yourself. This can suck, but damn does it feel good if you see the pounds drop. My recommendation would be: weigh yourself daily, in the morning. Log the weight, because you don't care about the difference to yesterday - having even multiple-pound jumps from one day to another is perfectly normal and nothing to be scared of. You care about the longer-term trend: one week to another, one month to the next. It's important to see the correct trend there - if the weight doesn't go down in these timespans, there's a mistake somewhere in your application of the process above, and you need to fix it.\n\nThat was just a short summary - /r/loseit has a great [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/faq) and is a very supportive and positive place. \n\n\nAs for workout: Go find stuff you like - you won't keep doing it unless you enjoy it. \n\nHowever, don't give up too early either. You probably simply started too fast, a very common mistake. \"You should run slow enough to be able to keep up a conversation\" is the rule of thumb. \n\nAlso, in the beginning you might get quite sore. It will take your body around a month, maybe a bit longer, to adapt - running stresses your body in different ways than walking does, and some muscles that have been a bit underused so far will be complaining. That's just an initial hump that you will get over if you persist. "

 {
  "text": "Props to you, it looks like other people have already gone into some depth, so I'll just add some of my thoughts.\n\nEat 3 meals a day, don't snack. Breakfast gets your metabolism going for the day, getting your body into the \"mindset\" of burning fat rather than storing it. Incorporate a lot of plants into your diet, learn to love those veggies! Eat protein-rich meats like chicken and Turkey. Eat better, not less. Eating less screws with your system and tells your body to store up because you're not getting as much as you used to. \n\nGet into the mindset that you are a healthy person, and stay there. This is a lifestyle choice, not just a phase. Squeeze in little mini workouts in your downtime. See how many pushups you can do in a minute, how many crunches, etc. Be conscious of how you spend your time, if you're sitting around for a long time get up and go for a walk around the neighborhood, squeeze a workout in.\n\nDon't let anyone else hold you back. Tell your parents your goals, if they support you that's great, if not, don't let them push you in a different direction. It can be hard at first, and it might feel like people are judging you, but don't let that bother you. You're doing this for you, not for anyone else.\n\nBe aware that muscle weighs more than fat, so as you become more fit you might not notice as much weight loss as you expect. Keep passing through that, you'll get where you want to be as long as you dedicate yourself to it and keep working at it.\n\nAs for exercises, just find the point where you can't do anymore, and set a point above that as your goal. Work up to it, when you finally reach that goal, make a new one. Always stay positive, it's going to take work but you can do it!"

  "text": "hey!\n\nI am an amateur and by no means a personal trainer or pro. However, I have been lifting for going on 5 years and lift 245 bench, 405 squat, and 405 dead lift and weigh 175 currently. A flat chest and stomahc is up to you. The heavier you are the stronger you will naturally be usually. Personally I found the most success aesthetically from a lower-ish carb diet. Meaning I dont count macros but rather keep track of the relaive amount of grains/ carbs I eat in a day. Usually I find that eating carbs up until noon and then a small amount after lifting to be a key to building muscle. I know this is a very broad answer but essentially a bowl of cereal for breakfast, some bread or a small plate of pasta for at lunch and then a small amount of rice or any carbs after lifting. Your muscles need to restore their energy stores after a workout in order to grow and recover properly. Also most protein bars are glorified candy bars and you are better off with protein shakes in that department.  Your reps and sets will define the way your body grows and develops. Lower reps and more sets are great for strength and making your muscles denser (not larger in appearance but more solid). Higher reps and fewer sets (and less rest) will hypetrophy your muscles and make them appear larger and better for endurance. If you chose to go with the higher reps and sets you will need more carbs and more calories in general. Eating 5 small meals a day in my experience as excellent for muscle building. If you are hungry, your body is out of fuel to digest and will begin digesting stores (your fat and muscles). Personally I found the most success by hitting 2-3 compound lifts at 5x5 then doing secondary groups 3x8/12. I.E. chest day 5x5 bench 5x5 incline 5x5 decline, chest flys 3x8, weighted dips 3x8, tricep extension 3x8, diamond pushups 3x8. \n\n\nSorry for the wordy response,  but overall, experiment with different rep and set combos to see what volume is best for you, as well as your food intake in comparison to your workouts. Best of luck and just keep researching!"

Unless you take growth hormone or steroids you probably won't be able to gain more than 0.5 to 1 pound of muscles per week as a beginner.

If anything, protein powder is a crutch for a beginner, because it doesn't allow you to naturally learn proper nutrition.   \nIf you're beginning, it's way better if you installed some app that measures your calorie/macronutrient intake first. If you see you're eating too little protein, change your diet. If that still doesn't cut it, THEN you supplement with whey.\n\nAs for creatine, to simplify - it increases water retention in your muscles. Slightly better strength results, slightly bigger muscles. For a beginner, it is easy to be charmed by these. But if you're just going to be taking it for the sake of it - don't. If you screw it up, your kidneys will suffer."

It's a gradual thing, built on months of repetition and slightly increasing weight loads over time, and before you know it, you'll see gains.\n-If you're trying to do a complicated routine, don't start with something basic, like 4 core lifts, and add auxiliary lifts from there.\n-I've grew up learning that it's all about intensity. If you go through your workout with leisure then you won't make the big gains. Always workout with intensity and with a purpose.\nThose are my tips for you today, I'm by no means an expert, But I learned a good bit about working out from my football coaches in high school. So if you want to chat, feel free to message me."

  "text": "Hey there twin! I am going to answer the question you didn't ask.\n\nFirst, congrats on starting to take the first mental step. You are going to get a lot of advice but let me share it from the the first person point of view (I was 324lbs. 2 months ago). My biggest problem with these forums are when people give advice without understanding the true situation the person is in and frankly unless you have been 300+ I don't think you are qualified to give advice to someone who is without legit education.\n\nStep 1: When you are this heavy your focus shold not be on excersize but on diet. By altering what you eat you can start melting weight off. Breakng it down simply you are taking in way more calories than you are buring and it is time to reverse that. Start educating yourself before diving in.  Learn how to calorie count and start eating 5 small meals a day. This helps you feel relatively full and keeps your metabolism going strong. Determine what your target calorie count for the day is and build your meals accordingly. Oh yeah, prepare your meals ahead of time to make things way easier.  Prep a whole bunch of small meals that you can grab when needed or else you are going to end up at the drivethru. Low calorie protein shakes make nice meal replacements as well. They are easy to make and filling.  You have to get used to eating less, deal with it. Go ahead and start with a 2,000 calorie target, I bet your taking in closer to 4k-5k now without even realizing it. These diets that say eat as much as you want but only of \"this type of food\" are BS for guys like us because they don't realize the kind of appetite we have. If I eat a bucket of low cal grilled chicken breasts I am eating super healthy but I am still going to take in so much food that the calories will exceed what I can burn, and I won't make any progress. Once you get your calories and portions under control you will realize you were actually eating enough food to feed a small village, even if it was healthy food, there were just too many calories being consumed.\n\nStep 2: Keep the excersize light. Your body doesn't function well when your this big, your are not meant to carry this much weight. It is easy to injur yourself right now and you don't want an injury because it will set you back before you get started. Start with a daily stretching routine.  Advance that routine into some yoga poses.  Focus on strengthening your core because your core supports your back and your back is vulnerable at this weight, especially if you have shitty posture I bet you have no core strength. Start walking but stop when things start hurting (feet, ankles, knees, hips, and back, pay attention to all of them).\n\nStep 3: Your body will let you know when it's time to increase your physical activity, but it is not ready right now. When your ready come back here and ask the question you just asked again.\n\nWrap Up: Things won't change over night but they can change real fast if you commit to it, especiall because your so young. I am 7 weeks into a new healthier lifestyle. I have dropped 60lbs. since starting (under 2 months) and I am only now getting ready to start lifting.  My benchmark was to hit 250lbs. before I went back to lifting but I am listenting to my body.  I have lost that weight so far purely off of diet and very light cardio.  I could barley squeek out walking a mile without my body throbing at 324lbs. but now I can go 3-5 miles no problem.  My body feels like it is being unshackled as I continue to lose and my mobility and energy are coming back.  I still have a long way to go but I am committed. You can do it too.\n\nPM me if you want any more details, I think I have written enough at this point. This is my $.02\n\n- 100lb. Beard"

My first recommendation would be to either go to your local high school gym or join a gym in your area. This will give you access to a wide variety of machines and free weights to work with. Next, find a well-rounded workout regimen. Something like this;\n* Day 1- Chest/Back\n*Day 2- Legs/Core(Abs)\n*Day 3- Arms/Shoulders\n\nAnd then feel free to mix in some cardiovascular exercises in there as well. As for the weight training. There are many different websites that can show you how to do different lifts for different muscle groups. Bodybuilding.com is probably one of my favorites. Keep it simple to start and don't try to lift the house on week one. You'll notice yourself getting stronger as long as you stick to it. If you have any questions feel free to ask. "

  "text": "If you want to accelerate your start the simplest way is to find a good trainer. Think about your goal, find some people you want to be look like. Describe all of this to your trainer, try to give as much information as possible. This will really speed up your progression. \n\n17 years old is a great time to start your body transformation. You have a lot of time to learn how to build muscle. Maybe this will tighten and entice you and that will be another way to start working out. This way requires more dedication and discipline. The risk of injury is much higher. On the other hand if you do not hurry up and try to learn to sense and control your body the result can exceed expectations. \n\nDiet is very important! This is another discussion but do not forget about this.\n\nThink about it and Choose your path. Good Luck!"

I worked out all the time, with little results. All I did was get even more lean. about 2.5 years ago I increased what I was eating, and kept training. I made sure to add rest days, get plenty of sleep, and ate about every 2 hours. I always seemed full, and never really wanted to eat, but knew I would have to if I wanted to get bigger. I didn't take any supplements, all I did was eat more. I tried to eat clean 80-90% of the time, and made sure to add in cheat meals so I didn't go insane. I am still 5' 10\" I now walk around 205-210 and 30 years old now. Don't know my body fat %, but I can say that I am not super lean like a games athlete, however I have abs / 6 pack. My arms are pretty shredded, I have big shoulders, and have big legs. I see a lot of people taking all sorts of supplements, and I am the example of you don't need it.

Don't just lift 6-8 every set. You need some 12-15's to move blood in and out of your muscle "

You are correct by doing heavy workouts, but only go as heavy as you can handle. A lot of people let their \"egos\" lift for them and it really impacts their gains.

  "text": "I was in the same boat, I thought I couldn't lose weight, and it took a big toll on me. I kinda messed up by not tracking my progress enough, but I do know in April I weighed 170 lbs or more (and was 156 lbs 6 weeks ago, now I'm 135). My weight loss was a very healthy way, there was days I was too full from eating my meal prep meals. I just made sure to work out a lot, I do realize not many people can workout 2 times a day and do 30-40 mins cardio and an hour of strength training. But start off with 30 mins cardio session and push ups (knee push-ups or push ups are amazing for your core and arms). \n\nAlso I'm getting older (pushing 30,) and my metabolism is slowing down. Here's a few tips you can use. I can't urge you enough to continue working out, once you slip, it's harder to get back. In the last 6 weeks, I lost 20 lbs without any skinny tea or pill. Take a picture of yourself right now, you're going to want to track your progress. I can't even tell you how amazing it felt to compare my pics after 4 weeks, and even after 6 weeks! \n\nI made sure I did a 30-40 min cardio session in the morning on an empty stomach. It could be dancing, biking, speed walking, running, just anything to get your heart rate up and you sweaty. Interval training is great too! (Interval training example= Run for 45 seconds and then walk for 30-40 seconds). Research and my personal experience has shown that a fasted cardio session is more effective in revving up your metabolism and boosting fat loss. I made sure I work out 5-6 times a week, and NO cheat meals (hard part, but not impossible). Losing weight is not about eating less, but enough to nourish our bodies in a smart way so you're not putting it in shock or starvation mode (your body will store your food as fat if you starve it too much). Anything you like, you can make a healthy version of it! Trust me, Google comes in handy for this. Eating less is not going to help you physically or mentally, and it's not healthy. You don't want to lose weight to look good, but to live long and healthy! \n\nThe best way to eat healthier is to meal prep, and make sure you eat meat and veggies, and 1/2 cup of carbs in the lunch or morning. Examples of meal prep for the week could be healthy breakfast burritos, salad for lunch, protein shake as 2 of your snacks (get a low carb powder formula). And meat and veggies for dinner. The more you learn about eating smart, the bigger difference you will see in your attitude and health. Water is really important, I had a hard time drinking a gallon of water so I would brew green tea and lemon tea, ice it and throw it in a pitcher and throw in some fruits, and it would taste amazing and help me get my gallon of water in every day.

  "text": "I was in the same boat, I thought I couldn't lose weight, and it took a big toll on me. I kinda messed up by not tracking my progress enough, but I do know in April I weighed 170 lbs or more (and was 156 lbs 6 weeks ago, now I'm 135). My weight loss was a very healthy way, there was days I was too full from eating my meal prep meals. I just made sure to work out a lot, I do realize not many people can workout 2 times a day and do 30-40 mins cardio and an hour of strength training. But start off with 30 mins cardio session and push ups (knee push-ups or push ups are amazing for your core and arms). \n\nAlso I'm getting older (pushing 30,) and my metabolism is slowing down. Here's a few tips you can use. I can't urge you enough to continue working out, once you slip, it's harder to get back. In the last 6 weeks, I lost 20 lbs without any skinny tea or pill. Take a picture of yourself right now, you're going to want to track your progress. I can't even tell you how amazing it felt to compare my pics after 4 weeks, and even after 6 weeks! \n\nI made sure I did a 30-40 min cardio session in the morning on an empty stomach. It could be dancing, biking, speed walking, running, just anything to get your heart rate up and you sweaty. Interval training is great too! (Interval training example= Run for 45 seconds and then walk for 30-40 seconds). Research and my personal experience has shown that a fasted cardio session is more effective in revving up your metabolism and boosting fat loss. I made sure I work out 5-6 times a week, and NO cheat meals (hard part, but not impossible). \n\nLet Google and YouTube be your personal trainer! But basic thing is, get cardio in, and strength training as well, maybe ask a friend, or watch a few YouTube videos focused on leg workouts, arm workouts, abs, etc. if you can't get weights, there's plenty of videos that have workouts without weights. \n\nThe best way to eat healthier is to meal prep, and make sure you eat meat and veggies, and 1/2 cup of carbs in the lunch or morning.

Assuming you're trying to build muscle, I would try to do at least 3 exercises per muscle group 4 sets of 10 each.\n\nFor example: Chest and Triceps\n\nDips 4 x 10-15\nBench 4 x 10\nIncline dumbbell chest press 4 x 10\nCable or regular flies 3 x 12\nCable tricep extensions 4 x 10-12\nSkull crushers 4 x 10\n\nYou can mismatch that any way that works for you(everyone's different). 4 x 10 is pretty standard but I personally like doing 4-5 sets and go from 12 reps to 10, 8, then 6. Increasing the weight each set to a point where you can hardly complete the last rep of each set. And then drop it back down to a starting weight and pump out 10 more as a finisher. "

On Bicep and Back day I'll usually do an Oblique machine, and heavy crunches on a machine. The other days I'll focus on Leg Raises and side dips.\n\n\nNow, the most important thing is eating. My exact macros are listed below. I usually eat 4 egg whites and one whole egg in the morning. In the eggs I add 6 slices of Black Forest ham, one whole tomato, 100 grams of onions, and 2 slices of Sara Lee wheat bread. Before that, I have 70 grams of oatmeal, one scoop of MyProtein Vanilla in the oatmeal, a whole banana, and a oatmeal raisin cliff bar. \n\nFor lunch I have 10 ounces of chicken breast and 10 ounces of brown rice. I add 8 table spoons of a low calorie salsa for flavor. Every other day I eat 4 servings of either sweet peas, or corn with the chicken and rice.\n\nFor dinner it's usually a beef or a fish. I had tuna steaks yesterday, today I will double up on my chicken. I also drink 2 scoops of protein with this meal because I workout around this time.\n\nRight before bed, I have a fruit (roughly 10ounces) and 2 apple cinnamon rice cakes with Waldens Farms chocolate syrup. And I drink one last scoop of protein with cinnamon, and vanilla extract to keep me anabolic over night.\n\nSee the macros below:\n\nProtein: 318g\nCarbs: 392g\nFiber: 53g\nSugar: 148g\nFat: 42g\n\n\nThis is the schedule and diet that works extremely well for me but it takes time. And you will want to switch up your workouts. All of the workouts I listed above are once a week. But I workout every muscle group twice a week. For instance, Monday I will do Bicep Back, Tuesday I will do Chest Tricep, Wednesday I will do Shoulders Legs, and then break one day. Friday is Bicep Back, Saturday is Chest Tricep, and Sunday is Shoulder Leg. \n\nRepeat and be consistent. You have to be consistent and you have to eat properly.\n\nHope this helps!"

  "text": "&gt; you’ll burn 1000 calories in under 10 minutes\n\nIf you burn calories, you'll exhale CO2. Assuming you normally burn 2000 calories a day, and you have [around 20000 breaths](http://www.answers.com/Q/How_many_breaths_does_a_person_average_each_day) to expel the CO2 produced by that.\n\nTo burn 1000 calories in 10 minutes, you'd need to pretty much exhale half of your daily volume of CO2 in those 10 minutes, so you'd breathe 10000 times in 10 minutes, or 1000 times per minute, or 16-17 times per second. Keep in mind those are full breaths, not some kind of flat hyperventilation.\n\nThis doesn't math. \n\nLet's try another way. You exhale [1kg](http://www.answers.com/Q/How_much_co2_does_human_body_emit) of CO2 per day. So let's estimate you'd have to exhale 500g of CO2 in 10 minutes. At [1.98kg/m³](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide#Physical_properties), that would be around 0.3 m³ or 300 litres of pure CO2. Each breath replaces around [350 ml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system#Gas_exchange) of gas in the lungs, so if you exhaled pure CO2 you'd have to breathe around 1000 times in 10 minutes, 100 times per minute or 1-2 times a second. Of course, you only exhale [~ 5% CO2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing#Composition), so we have to multiply that by a factor of 20, so around 35 breaths/second.\n\nSo I highly doubt burning 1000 calories in 10 minutes is possible. Maybe someone wants to estimate whether your clothes would catch fire from the heat produced if you did?"

You can start with just avoiding junk food and doing long walks/elliptical 4 days a week and you can make a lot of progress. I would not take cheat days, because they can erase so much progress if you go crazy. Instead, maybe just cheat very rarely, like once a week, and only for a specific thing, like you happen to be faced with a beautiful cookie, and your gonna work out tonight anyway.  "

It's easy to find healthy(ier) versions of what you love on Pinterest. \nI notice a lot of people are all about low fat, no sugar, low carb diets. Be careful with that mindset. Carbs are in EVERYTHING, even vegetables, so fearing carbs is pointless. Fat is good for you, but know what kind of fat you're consuming and don't add more than what you need. 2 tablespoons of olive oil is plenty to sautee veggies. YOU NEED SUGAR. Sugar is your friend. It gives you energy and makes you feel geeeewwwwd. Sugar betrays you when there isn't any fiber to slow down the break down process in your body. For example, compare soda to an Apple. Both have a crap ton of sugar in them, but only one has fiber and nutrients. Your body has to use energy to break down the Apple to absorb anything from it. Your body will pretty much just absorb the soda straight away, be bombarded with all of this energy, and immediately start storing it as fat because it doesn't know what to do. ALWAYS EAT FRUIT!  What it comes down to is learning about basic biochemistry and nutrition. That will definitely help you understand how to diet better.\nWhen it comes to exercise, do what you enjoy! Not everyone likes lifting weights. It's kind of boring to be honest. Try new activities and find something you have fun doing. You need to look forward to working out! Try archery, martial arts, swimming, dance, pole dancing, Ariel arts, hula hooping, cycling, rock climbing, skateboarding.....anything! There is so much out there. Only two things matter when you're working out : you're being safe and you're sweating. \nGET ADEQUATE SLEEP. You would be surprised how much lack of sleep effects your body. Lack of sleep causes stress. Stress causes production of cortisone. Cortisone causes fat storage. Sleep. Sleeeeeeeeeeeep......\nDrink your water. Drink a gallon. Everyday. Drink it with stuff in it, like lemon wedges or strawberries or cucumber. Drink it.\nReplace sugar with honey or coconut sugar. Coconut sugar is low glycemic. Honey is really really good for you. But keep it local and raw honey to get the best results. \nTake care of your heart and mind. Bad thoughts and feelings produce cortisone which means fat storage. Don't be negative towards yourself, even if you eat like a whole cake in a day amd watch Netflix for 7 hours. It's ok to slack sometimes. Just make up for it the next day! "

Its hard to focus on fixing my positions when there are no pauses in the speech, the first pause to allow me adjustment to suggestions is at 3 min. I would suggest telling us correct posture and then telling the biker story while im getting myself adjusted. \n\n\nSecond, Explain to me how I should do things either during or immeadetly after transition. E.G. at 1:30 you tell us we're starting seated, and you dont tell us how to sit until 2:15. Another example would be at 3:40 you tell us to stand up, and dont tell me how to stand up properly till about 5:15 when you give the 4 tips. With the fast paced videos, I was already standing by the time you told me how.\n\nThird, I would emphasise when transitioming between exercises. The amount of talking in the same tone kinda makes my mind relax. In the video you go \"all right, its time to stand up\" if you went more along with \"ALL RIGHT, its time to stand up\". This tip combined with the first tip means I can relax and adjust, when I hear the \"ALL RIGHT\" I can bring my full attention back to the video and move on. \n\nThank you for sharing these exercises!

My mind is probably too distracted by everything going on in the filming process to remember to change it. However, that is one of the things I work on in my daily filming practice so thanks for pointing it out because it means I will focus on it more. \n\nAgain thanks for the feedback."

You need to work off of how much calories you're burning a day and then work off of that. \n\nTo be honest though man drinking is going to hinder your progress not by a lot, but  you'd see more progress if you cut that out as much as possible. There aren't any specific workouts that are going to make you shed fat like crazy like I said most of that is based off of your diet. Same with building muscle.\n\nAnother thing is that if you start to eat right and you haven't been working out a lot you may start to gain weight on the scale before you start to lose it because of new muscle. In reality at the end of your program you may have lost 12lbs of fat but you weigh only six pounds less because of muscle growth. \n\nJust take it one day at a time measure progress in weeks since you're just going to be starting out and don't expect an overnight change.

What might work for you may not work for others, and vice versa.\n\nFirst you need to know your goals. If you want to lose weight, then you need to expend more calories than you intake. Go to Google and type in \"basal metabolic rate calculator\". Follow the steps. This will    \nTell you about  how many calories your body will burn in a day WITHOUT doing any excersise. It will also tell you how many calories you should intake per day. What you want to do is get a few hundred calories below that mark.\n\n1 pound of fat is = 3500 calories. So if you burn, let's  say just for this example, 1000 calories per day more than you consume, it will take you 3.5 days to burn 3.5 pounds of fat. This illustration is a bit extreme, but you get the idea.\n\nSince you don't have access to a gym, I suggest researching bodyweight excersises, or calisthenics. These are workouts based on no equipment. The army uses bodyweight workouts only, just to explain it's effectiveness. Granted, your not going to build a bodybuilding physique with these however.\n\nJust some things to look up to help you out, check out \"brendan meyers\" on you tube.  He helped me out alot.

I'm doing a bit  of jogging,  abs, free weights and was sore my first couple of days.  Now the soreness is nonexistent until I go the next weight higher.

People who are there already would help you with progress, just do lots of practice and you would be able to get ahead in no time.\nUse motivational apps, or follow motivational quotes on Pinterest, Facebook etc. \nDon't think that exercise techniques matter more at this stage as in the beginning it is all about motivation and keeping the mind on track. \nAvoid drinking or cut down drastically, as it would dehydrate you and make you lazy. \nDon't eat sugary stuff or cake although tis the season, so just sparingly if relatives or friends insist. \nKrav maga is about movement and in the beginning your trainer will focus on the feet and balance. Again - mind over technique. Keep your mind in check, and the next stages would follow easily.\nKeep a diary and measure the progress you make with movements, I.e., how fast you were executing a certain move compared to the last time. Buy a good sports watch, not expensive, just good. Don't waste money on Fitbit unless your hard work paid off and you feel you actually deserved it. \nKeep your sleep rhythm in control.

Bench is an important lift, but honestly squats, deadlifts, and overhead presses are 3 of the most important lifts to gain size with. Plus doing only bench everyday isn't going to give you the results you are looking for. You want to mix in multiple chest lifts so your body won't get used to the same routine. Same with arms lifts. Different lifts hit different parts of the muscle which in return promote growth. "

Remember everything you put in your body has to be processed. Very few things simply get \"passed through\". I personally took creatine on and off for almost 15 years. One day my doctor noticed I had high creatinine levels after a blood test and asked me about it. I decided to stop taking it because I was 30, married, and even though I still love working out, I don't compete or take it as seriously as I used to. I've read that creatine will create a \"false positive\" on your blood test, just like it did to me. But the other side is that if I'm taking creatine and I truly DO have a kidney problem, the doctor will not be able to use high creatinine levels as an indicator."

Then what follows is better feeling, and more enthusiasm towards said excercise/workout program, and by default you start to want to get more out of it by changing diet habits. One step at a time, you'll change for the better, which yet again pushes you to keep going. \n\nBottom line. Find something you love doing. And its not workout anymore, Its fun."

  "text": "In my experience, as you bulk you give your body WELL over what it will need to maximize its muscle production, etc. Bulking in my sense does mean I will gain some fat, however I also gain the most amount of muscle I could as well. That is when cutting would come into play where you would cut your calories a bit each day from your BMR (google this) and then you will slowly lose that fat while retaining most of the muscle. So to answer question, if you are just starting I would personally bulk like crazy, be amazed at the strength you gain, workout as much as POSSIBLE a day...(the more you do it the more you will gain man) and just try to get big. This is my personal experience. I first stared working out while also toning (usually called cutting) and I did look amazing compared to before. However, when I started upping my calories from 3000 to 5000 a day and working out 2 hours a day, I increased my strength tremendously. Deadlifts increased, bench press, etc. now if I decide to cut my fat with a very productive and lean cut, I'm going to be able to keep most if not all of those strength gains while having a toned body!"

Try basic free apps like MyFitnessPal to track what you eat.  The first week change nothing just honestly track everything you've eaten.  Then look back on the week and find areas you could easily cut like soda or diet soda, fatty foods, chips, fries, candy, dessert.

Probably a good idea to actually get someone to design a program for you personally if you want to be the most efficient. A month isn't crazy if you only need to lose 4kg.

Try not to train several large muscle groups in one day, or you can also try to combine antagonists training like back and chest at the same workout.\n \nGood luck!"

Most weight loss comes from cutting back on calories not exercise. Exercise is mostly beneficial to heart health and long term fitness. \n\nEdit: through my day I eat small portions of things.

Everyone was a beginner at one point and they can teach you a lot. Also it's great for motivation both ways.\n• Watch a lot of YouTube videos to learn correct form and to find new exercises. My favorite channel is Athlean X because he explains each muscle group as well as how to strengthen them.\n• Improve your diet. It doesn't have to be a major change all at once. Even little things like cutting out soda and fast food are a good way to start."

  "text": "Definitely watch Athlean X and I also like Scott Herman Fitness. One thing a lot of people don't understand is that you need to eat a good amount of food to gain muscle. I typically aim for 2500-3000 calories a day but I think that mostly boils down to preference. Also if you do it correctly (put on muscle I mean) you are going to gain a pinch of fat. It is inevitable since you need to eat a lot. Now like prozzi said don't eat food that is bad for you like fast food, soda, candy etc and use the excuse that you need to get calories in. You could do that but it would be an unhealthy bulk and you would gain more fat than normal. I try to stick to chicken, meat, pastas, potatoes, and something that really helps is peanut butter (it keeps you full and has lots of protein). Also like he said get people at the gym to teach you or get a friend that works out. When I stated I would just go up to people and ask them what muscles the exercise they were doing worked and almost everyone was more than willing to help. I know I was kinda of all over the place so if you have any questions about what I said just lmk "

  "text": "First and foremost, good job getting into a workout routine! I don't know if you had been semi active before you've started on this current type of workout for the last month and a half, but either way, kudos to you. \nWhen it comes to working out and exploring protein choices I would first recommend that you take a look at your diet and evaluate how much protein you get from the food you eat. You're working out/doing resistance training 3 times a week so on those days you definitely want to up your protein intake (obviously). You should have a solid amount of protein for every meal but a particularly important time to make sure you have protein in your system is within the hour after you finish exercise. This is called your anabolic window. After you workout, your body is going to start revving up to breakdown the damaged muscle tissue and set up for building more (hypertrophy). Eating a combination of protein and carbs will give your body a pool of glucose and amino acids to pull from in the reactions that take place to breakdown/build up muscle. The majority of your protein should come from your food. \nThe only time I would really recommend that you use supplements like protein powder is if you are not getting enough protein from your diet. For those guys and girls that workout for prolonged periods of time in the gym doing extensive/high intensity resistance training, the amount of protein that they need to ingest might be unrealistic to expect from their diet. So that's where the protein powders come in.\nIf you are seriously considering using protein powder, a good start would be to look into whey protein which is very common. Whey protein is quick to metabolize, so drinking it within your anabolic window will give you a good boost of amino acids that will be readily available for your body to use. That's a good thing! Protein powders that have at least 80% whey protein are solid options. You want more bang for your buck! What's the point of drinking protein powder if most of it isn't in fact protein? Check the ingredients list on the protein powders. If they don't have a form of whey listed as the first ingredient then they probably aren't very densely packed with protein.\nI would be careful though. Just because you use protein powder does not mean you will get muscles faster. It just ensures that you're giving your body the building blocks it needs to build the muscle. Just packing your diet with tons of protein is not the solution for everyone. If you eat too much protein and you don't need all of it then your body can use it to produce fat as a means to store energy. Our bodies are fantastic that way and it was very handy back when early hunter/gatherers needed to save the extra stores of energy in case they went without food. \nSo I'll end this loooonnnggg response by saying, check to see how much protein you get from your diet. Look online for apps that give good suggestions to how much protein you should be eating based on your fitness level (it will give you a ballpark estimate at least) and compare the two. If you are coming up short in your diet then consider eating a higher proportion of protein in you diet and if you still think that isn't enough then explore your options for protein powders that have a very high proportion of protein. I use ON gold standard whey protein powder, but don't just use that because that's what I use. Do your homework! Part of the fun of getting into a workout regimen is experimenting to see what type of exercise and what diet works best for your body. Everyone is different. Plus, you're 15. You have so much of your prime years ahead of you to see what works. Diet first. Supplements later."

Over the years I have tried many different supplements and nutritional complexes, so further approval is based on a purely personal experience. Absolutely all sports supplements can be useful only for experienced athletes and only during periods of limiting the total calorie content of your diet. The turnover of sports supplements has long exceeded a billion dollars and most of the studies that prove the use of the protein shake after training are actually far-fetched. In fact, the so-called \"protein-carbohydrate window\" is open at least a full day after your workout. Therefore Do not hurry to eat after your workout. Give your preference to freshly prepared homemade foods and I guarantee you an excellent increase in strength and muscle mass.\nIMHO"

  "text": "Well, my best advice would be this: for about one to two weeks, do pushups and situps at home. Start with 20 reps each set and get in three sets a day. Every day, increase pushups by 2 and situps by 5 until failure. Challenge yourself. After this, find a friend that has been going to the gym for a while and ask if you can workout with them. Work with them for about a month and then tweak their workout to your preferences. An example of what a week of working out might look something like this: Monday-Chest. Tuesday-Biceps and Triceps.  Wednesday-Back. Thursday-Shoulders. Friday-Legs. Some Chest exercises would be bench press(normal, incline, and decline) and flys. Some bicep and tricep exercises would be curls(bar or dumbbells are fine) and skullcrushers. Some back exercises would be rows(machine are dumbbells) and t bar pulls. Some shoulder exercises would be military press and lateral raises. Lastly, some leg exercises would be squats and leg press. Keep in mind that this is just an example and that it doesn't have to be like this. Missing a workout is not terrible if you aren't missing workouts twice or more times a week, but make sure to never stop lifting for more than two weeks at a time if you absolutely must.

  "text": "In fact, for large muscle groups, such as the legs, the recovery period is very important if we focus on their growth. The second thing you need to pay attention to is the amount of glycolytic muscle fibers that depends on your genetics. It usually takes some time to determine the optimal training program for yourself, so I recommend that you start a minimum number of repetitions in set and maximize the rest between your legs workouts. In order to involve more muscle fibers you need to slow down the pace of the movement. I'm sure that this compensates a small number of repetitions and will increase the total time of loading muscles. "

It's no program to bulk or anything, but it really eases you into exercise. \n\nI think someone mentioned before that your bones aren't used to/ready for this type of stress. 100% true. Wolffs law. The more you exercise and train your bone density will respond and add more bone. Then you'll be able to lift/do more because of it. So starting off slowly is very important.

Good that you have full range of motion. My initial guess would be minor dislocation. But that usually has range of motion restrictions. \n\nAgain I'd see someone about this if it doesn't resolve itself after a couple weeks. "

The goal each time is more!\n\nFind a good beginner program i.e. Fierce 5 and go from there.\n\nYou should see decent gains in your first year if you stick at it. Good luck."

  "text": "To add to the first two comments, just work at your own pace, but also know when you are reaching muscle failure or exhaustion. When you get to the point of throwing up, go take a shower, relax, take your bottle of water with you or your results and recovery formula if you drink those, or even a protein shake, and feed your muscles. Also you can take a long shower, and let the hot water relax your muscles and help your body calm down. Start out with a cool shower, and work your way up to warm. Try to do at least one more rep each day, but don't overdo it. You don't need to max out, you don't need to look like everybody else, you need to go at your own pace so that you don't injure yourself. Make sure you're eating right, cut out sodas, as many foods that have added sugar, try to basically eat a diet that's as raw as possible. I'm not saying eat raw meat, but raw vegetables, steamed vegetables, fruit, light, minimally processed food, unprocessed, get your meat from a local farmer, try to stay away from all the additives and preservatives. Also watch out for salt you can dehydrate you quickly. I would drink half of your body weight in ounces of water per day, and replace one of those servings of water with a protein shake mixed with water. That way you're still getting electrolytes. "

You can lose fat which will make you look unhealthy but you will probably get down to whatever muscle you have, and some rib definition. If that's what girls go for nowadays then go for it. Cardio yourself to exhaustion.\n\nIf you want to put on muscle, you'll be lucky to pack on a pound - 2 pound in a month. And you can't just pack on muscle into your abs without adding it anywhere else. The body likes to grow together.\n\nSo the advice is, to make the best start you can with muscle gains, eating plenty, lifting, ab work etc. In 5 weeks you won't be mr big but you will look better. Keep doing it until next summer and you'll be amazed.\n\nThere is no quick fix. End of. Take the advice or leave it."

Who says I'm trying to use my body to get girls or anyone for that matter? If that was my goal I'd say it.\n\nYour first post was okay, another poster was extremely rude and insulting. You didn't become rude until you started talking about Schwarzenegger and ignoring my question.\n\nYou think I'm rude because you are missing the fact that I'm my own person. Imagine someone asking for help finding the right headlight bulb for their chevy truck and every response being \"you should get a ford truck instead\". Then you call this person rude for wanting an answer to the question they asked.\n\nI have my own goal. You might have zero desire for the same goal and you might not understand why anyone would want something different from you, but if you stop projecting maybe you could help me.\n\n\"I really just want help finding this headlight bulb.\"\n\n\"You need to get a Ford bro. You're not listening to anyone. You're being rude. You don't have a truck. You have a pile of junk metal. You can drive around in that Chevy and look like an idiot, if that's what girls go for this day. Realistically you can put away $400 a month to save up for a Ford truck. In a year you can get financing. So my advice is to cut your spending and start saving up for that Ford.\""

So if \"life doesn't exist after 5 weeks\" then surely that's your only option.\n\nSide note. From one guy to another. Losing a lot of weight could make you look unhealthy so just be careful. If you want a decent 6 pack and an alright body in the long run (if life doesn't actually end after 5 weeks) then think about bulking until you have what you are looking for."

Whatever your reasons.\n\nAll I can do is try put myself into your situation. What would I do in this exact scenario. \n\nI'd hit a slight calorie deficit, eating healthy, not crap. Plenty of water. Plenty of sleep. And I'd do some high intensity interval training 5-6 days a week. Check out insanity work outs if you haven't heard of them. I did it in my mid twenties when I was smaller in build and I was really happy with my cut. If you can stream them, It's 90 days for the program but just give it all you have for 5 weeks. Roughly 45 mins a day. There are other options available on YouTube. Just make sure there's elements of core work thrown in.\n\nKeep in mind, HIIT will require more calorie intake, even with the deficit.\n\nIt's not guaranteed. This might not work for you but with the 5 week window, whatever you decide, for god sake don't chop and change cos you don't think something is working.

Common causes are you're not belly breathing, or your ribs are fixated enough where you don't have enough expansion. I'm a chiropractor so that's my area of expertise. Advice: focus on breathing with whatever exercise you're doing. Classic example: bench.

If you just workout your arms for a couple years, they will look silly when compared to your chicken legs.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI would recommend creating some sort of simple \"split\", where you workout upper body one day and lower body another day. Workout 3-4 days a week and rest on the other days. Focus on compound exercises that work a lot of muscle groups at once. Think bench press, pull ups, and squats. Once you have a solid base of fitness and are more comfortable in the weight room, then you can start creating a program that is more tailored to your goals.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI just of just threw a random assortment of fitness tips for beginners at you.

Plus dumbbell workouts for the chest or back also work out your arms better because they work other muscles needed to stabilize the dumbbells while in use. This is the main reason I work with dumbells as much as possible then finish my workout on a machine which limits mobility. Lastly when you work up past the given weights you can look around for a second hand sporting goods store (play it again sports) and buy cheap used plates for 1/2 as much as a regular sporting goods store would sell. Don't overdue it if you don't start seeing results right away, especially if you're lifting alone. Good luck "

Training with bells combines work for your strength growing, development of endurance and flexibility. The likelihood of injuries is also very low, due to the fact that movements are mainly natural. Since the basic exercises are complex (more than the 1 joint involved) - you can get a huge stimulus to the growth of muscle mass at the hormonal level. I recommend that you Steve Cotter`s materials.

I also gained about 10 kg in a few months, without actually becoming fat. Of course this might not be the case for you but seeing your story (which is exactly the same as my story) this might work well for you too! Also try to monitor how much kcal you consume per day, if you want to gain with your (probably) fast metabolism you'll have to eat somewhere near 2800-3000 kcal per day (but don't start eating unhealthy because you need the calories!).

Avoid all starches, no bread, rice, potatoes, chips, tortillas - nothing. Also avoid milk and cheese. Eat vegetables, eggs, chicken, bacon, etc. Snack instead on carrots, celery, cucumbers and hummus. Nuts and olives if you need the salty fix. One day a week (I did Sundays) you get a cheat meal (pizza, always). You have that to look forward to and it makes eating well the rest of the week much easier. \n\nThis becomes a habit that can be easy to maintain. The cheat meal per week is key for the mental part - no one can say no to temptation all the time but if it's limited to a specific day, it's doable."

Then you want tons of veggies with it in form of salad with a fat dressing to ensure you get your fats in. Lastly you want to eat carbs but you want complex carbs like quinoa , brown rice, etc. \n\nFinally , you need to identify your macros for cutting while at least trying to maintain your muscles since they help burn the fat plus protein heavy diet uses much more energy to get digested and absorbed than carb heavy diet which in turn will rev up your metabolism. \n\nThe video here is what I used as my macro calculator. https://youtu.be/dkCT-hAP8SU\n\nFor full disclosure , one thing I can tell you is that the \"bro diet\" isn't always the best one to stick to, so try and build up to it using principle called IIFYM  (if it fits your macros). It isn't ideal but ensuring that you eat but hit your macros will still help you cut down. \n\nAt the end, it takes patience and consistency, always remember that the fat didn't appear overnight and won't go away overnight either. So keep going at it and you'll see the change happen slowly but surely."

All that stuff about macros, and specialized muscle targeting and rest days etc is for people who are working out *much* harder than a beginner is ready for. \n\nWork out 4-6 days a week for 40-60m. The routine of doing it is what's important in the beginning. Don't kill yourself - your goal should be very mildy sore the next day. A good metric is always that you could carry on a conversation but not sing a song during your workout. Just do all over stuff within your skill set. Aim for 10-15 reps of whatever. If you can do way more it's not hard enough if you can't get to 10 it's way too hard. Set small, reasonable goals for yourself. If you can do 10 consecutive pushups today aim for 20 in 2 weeks. \n\nIf you don't know how to use the equipment or feel foolish hire a trainer for a few sessions to show you. There are tons of workouts online that you can follow for free. \n\nFor diet she was all about the 'eat real food' approach. 3 meals a day. Protein the size of your hand, veggies the size of your hand. If there's a bit more of other stuff that's okay, but hit those 2. No drinks -diet, fruit juice, protein shakes or otherwise, no fried food, no processed foods. Keep a food journal if it's hard for you. A little flex is okay, but don't go overboard. Alcohol - 2-3 glasses a week, max. If you get hungry between meals eat an apple and know you didn't eat enough protein at your last. It's not about limiting food intake - it's about getting *enough* of the right foods.  \n\nThe best diet and workout plan is the one you will stick with. Don't kill yourself and have fun with it!\n\nPay attention to your core and your breathing. Pull your belly button back to your spine to stabilize your core so you don't injure yourself on pretty much any movement you do. Breathe out with the flex and in with the extension. Keep movements steady and 'rythmic'. Pay attention as you go through a movement. (I still chant breathe out, belly button back, breathe in as I go through movements. It's become second nature)\n    "

There is a lot of good info there from beginners to advanced. "

Spilt your week into different muscle groups. I usually do \n\n1. Legs \n2. Chest, traps \n3. Legs \n4. Back, delts \n5. Arms \n\nNot necessarily in that order but roughly that. (my legs respond really poorly so I have to hit them twice for them to make any real gains). Your routine should probably be different then mine because your body is different. Oh I also do abs everyday at the end of my workouts for 15 minutes and calves (#TeamNoCalves) every other day regardless of which muscle im working. "

  "text": "I'm an older guy but I exercise like a crazy man. I live in a hot climate so I have to run early - before sunrise - else it gets too hot. I run 5 miles per day, every day except Sunday. Then I shower and head to the gym for an intense 1 hour workout alternating upper body one day and lower body the next. This combination gives me a balanced look, not muscle bound like a bodybuilder nor thin like a distance runner. This was my goal and I've been able to maintain it for many years. I don't always eat healthy (bad sweet tooth) but all of the calories I burn compensates. If you drop weight (and don't want to) then increase protein consumption. If you want to lose weight then reduce calories (keep protein, drop anything else). We all love to talk about ourselves and what works for us - I like to talk about it more because I truly wish people understood the importance of exercise - it improves your health and I think it improves your ability to think and even be 'kind.' This works for me. "

  "text": "There is no 'one' magic answer but rather a concept. The young guys that I've seen struggle like you are describing is because they truly don't understand that lifting means pushing your mind and body - hard. I see young guys get on the bench, do 65 lbs times 7 relatively easily and then they repeat that for 5 sets. That's not lifting, that's cardio. You have to train your mind that you are going to push as much weight as you possibly can without dropping the bar on your neck. You have to do that with every exercise and you have to do the exercises that you don't want to (squats, dead lifts, etc). That's why the big guys at the gym are grunting - cause they are pushing as hard as they possibly can. You need to be sore the next day. And on top of that you need lots of protein. Now, someone will come along and say all of the above is BS - it's not - it's tried and true and there are no shortcuts. Eventually you'll get to the point where your body is where you want it, then you can maintain, but until then you have to train like a crazy man."

You may not believe me, but at the age of 21 I weighed the same 120 pounds. After a year of active training and a gradual increase in the calorie content of my diet, my weight was about 210 pounds. I focused on quality carbohydrate food. This includes cereals (buckwheat, oatmeal, brown rice), pasta from durum wheat, whole wheat bread. I recommend starting with 100 grams of cereals in dry form 3 times a day. It is better to combine several types of complex carbohydrates in 1 day. For example, for breakfast 100 grams of oatmeal, for lunch 100 grams of buckwheat and for dinner 100 grams of pasta. In 2-3 weeks you can add a little bread for lunch, after a few weeks, increase the portion for breakfast and so on. Also, do not forget about protein products, if you need not just fat mass but also muscular. Eggs, chicken, low-fat cheese and beef perfectly complement your basic meals. Good luck!"

For example, if you have trouble with the bottom of your bench press, you can lower the weight, and pause at the bottom of the press. This will strengthen the bottom of the movement and thus, increase the amount of weight you can push!"

Force yourself to drink clean water. Start with 2 liters per day.\n\nGood luck!"

Didn't do great on eating smaller meals throughout the day, but did make a nice meal of couscous, thai curry, carrots, onions and garlic. I'm trying to move up to 80 sit ups and 60 push ups today, and definitely going skateboarding tonight for cardio. I may not know exactly what I'm doing but I think that as long as I try to maintain a discipline for being the best version of myself, I am on the right track. A taste of the healthy life may very well get me addicted to it. Before you know it I'll be a GNC-certified, whole foods health nut in a visor and white new balances.\n\nOne thing I neglected to mention is that I do sometimes drink to excess. It's just something I enjoy doing and it's not been a problem in my social or family life. I do however know that it's just about the most health-destroying thing you can do so in the spirit of getting better, I am going to try to slow down on the drinking. I guess this thread is going to be for me to track my progress...in the spirit of honesty in the will to change, full disclosure about my lifestyle and habits only makes sense. \n\nI will be tracking my ups and just as importantly, downs during this process. Wish me luck! Off to do more secret workouts in the back room at work :)"

Still trying to eat right but I am having a really hard time narrowing down what exactly is good for me and what is not so great. There is a massive amount of contradictory information online regarding nutrition and working out - that overload of conflicting information is what had me wary of starting this whole process in the first place. I don't want to be \"running in place\" so to speak. I mean that I don't want to be putting in a lot of work trying to exercise and eat \"right\" and then find out a year later that I've been doing it completely wrong. My current strategy is to just adopt a nutrition/fitness plan that is an average of everything I've seen thus far. It's really irritating that even highly respected and trusted gurus often have completely opposite advice from each other. There is a lot of elitism in the fitness world in the form of authoritative preaching about which workouts to do and not to do. Merrrgh.\n\nAte a lunch of granola, greek yogurt, blackberries, raisins, and almonds. A big part of why it's hard for me to eat smaller meals more frequently instead of one big meal per day is because I generally don't feel hungry for the better half of the day until around 2 or 3. Must train myself to not feel nauseous and rushed in the morning. I guess that's just another aspect of this whole \"discipline for life\" thing that I'm trying to change about myself. Staying positive!\n\nAnyway, a friend lent me his TRX suspension trainer so I'm going to try doing a circuit with that tonight. Planning on my usual 100 pushups, 120 situps by EOD as well.

So just doing a bunch of squats isn't going to make your legs skinny. Burning total body fat is the only way to go. That being said toning the muscles in your legs will help them look thinner. \nAs far as pre workouts they are generally just pumped full of caffeine to help you feel pumped and energetic at the gym. Some contain creatine and other stuff to help muscle growth.\nThe most important thing to remember is that you can't outwork a bad diet. Don't get discouraged if you aren't seeing the results as fast as you want. It's usually the hips and thighs that give women trouble getting rid of that last bit of fat.\nOne last tip.

Listen carefully, under control and slowly follow all the basic exercises. You should find a convenient technique for yourself to do the exercise, it may take some time. Show your interest and begin to learn the principles of workout and nutrition plan construction. \n\nIf you want a quick guide, then here it is:\n1) Focus on Complex Movements like squats, deadlifts, snatches etc. And put this exercises on the beginning of your workout.\n\n2) 1 hour training 3-4 times a week will be great. 3-5 exercises with 3-4 working sets with 8-15 reps in each set will be enough for begining.\n\n3) Diet is the main factor of your body transformation progress. We can argue long than to sacrifice carbohydrates or fats but the most important is the nutrition plan. The main thing is to develop a nutrition plan that will be right for you and which you can strictly adhere to.\n\n4) You need to drink more clean water. 2 liters is a minimum but you need more. \n\n5) Do not be guided by a quick result.

  "text": "Hello! First of all I must say that pain do not leads to gain directly. But its absence is one of the signs that your muscles have adapted to the load, and you do not have excessive accumulation of lactic acid, which leads to pain.\n\nHere is a few recommendations completely taken from my own experience:\n\n1) Reduce the number of your lower body trainings. Perhaps your muscles do not have much time to recover and that is why you can not shift your results and fully load your glutes.\n\n2) Try changing the order and quantity of exercises. You can, for example, replace deadlift with flexing with a barbell on the back etc.\n\n3) I can assume that your buttocks are hardy enough, since you play basketball 3 times a week. Perhaps you have initially incorrectly built your training program. Again, I can assume that you will be helped by heavier weights and fewer repetitions in the approach. \n\n4) I also advise you to try to fully control the movement, do the exercise slower so you can see where exactly the load goes. Perhaps your back and quadriceps take most of the load.\n\n5) Choose free weights for large muscle groups, so you can maximize the use of your muscle fibers.\n\n3 months is not really a long enough term, but you probably need to make edits in your training program. Good luck! "

  "text": "When you workout and it starts to get difficult your body uses lactic acid for energy. Over time your body will clear the lactic acid out post workout. The soreness is leftover lactic acid in the muscle. As you workout more your body will become more efficient at removing that lactic acid. \n\nWhen you first start working out, depending on how hard you go it's possible to be sore from one workout for all the way up to two weeks. This means that unless you want to only be working out once every two weeks you need to either workout sore or scale back your training intensity until your body can handle it. My philosophy is that if you're still a little sore it's okay to train. But if you're really sore it's best to wait it out and then go easier next time. \n\nAlso as a rule of thumb you should always give each muscle group worked 48-72 hours to recover, no matter how experienced you are.

  "text": "Hello! I think you doesn't need high calorie foods for muscle gain. You must focus on complex carbohydrates like oatmeal, buckwheat, brown rice, pasta from durum wheat. You can start with 250-300 grams in dry form per day. Once the weight gain stops you can gradually increase the amount of complex carbohydrates to 400 grams per day. It is very important to use such products every day. In general, any meal plan implies its constant fulfillment. This will allow you to analyze and adjust it for yourself.\n\nThe second problem may be lack of water in your diet. 2,5-3 liters per day is the minimum for an actively training young man. \n\nFew words about training. You must focus on complex movements like squats, deadlifts, thrusts, jerks, snatches etc. Use free weights so you engage the larger muscle mass. Try to constantly increase the working weights in such exercises, otherwise you will just be tagged in place.\n\nGood Luck!"

It may \"make you stronger\", allowing you to lift more intensely when fasting (which makes sense, if you think that animals have to be faster/stronger/more focused when hungry, for the sake of being more efficient hunters), but this might not be a difference that you're able to notice. Maybe just enough for one more rep, or a more complete last rep. \n\nAs always, though, there are other academic studies concluding that there is no difference between being fasting and not being fasting when a workout session happens. \n\nLike everything, it narrows down to what is best FOR YOU.

I alternate my muscles groups day by day so I don't fatigue them too quickly. For instance, today I worked on bi and triceps, as well as the row machine for my back. Tomorrow, I'll most likely do my leg muscles. Then I finish it off with 20-25 minutes of more cardio to round it out, and then I stretch a lot! \n\nIt depends on the equipment that your gym has  I'm gonna assume that it has most things you can find at any other gym. If there's not a lot in the weightlifting department, your own body weight is great too!! \n\nI would recommend bodybuilding.com for any beginner weight programs, and other health websites for starting cardio programs. \n\nHope this helps!!"

Mind you I'm talking about protein grams, and not grams of food that contain protein. There is a BIG differece. \n\nWeight-wise, since you don't have a gym nearby nor room for a lot of equipment, I'll suggest a self-evaluation: how many reps of each body weight exercise can you do non-stop (push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, etc)? You mentioned dumbbell curls. How many reps can you do in a row? If these numbers are all higher than 15, then you definitely need some weight to work with. If the numbers are below 10, you can keep doing them for a bit and max those reps out.\n\nAs a good rule of the thumb, without getting into anything too complex here, Try and keep your reps always between 4 and 10. Also, always alternate between low reps (4 to 6) and high reps (6 to 10) exercises. When you can easily surpass these numbers, put on some weight on the bars and keep going.\n\nOn top of lifting, try some calisthenics. Watch some YouTube videos about how to get started and go for it.\n\nGood luck!"

  "text": "I think it is not a good idea. If you want a bigger arms, then give them more rest. I want to note that when you train your biceps and triceps in the same workout, your shoulder joint is also included in the work and your shoulders also experience a certain load. Yes, arms muscles are small and can be recovered in a short period, but you should think about enough rest for your joints. I think It will be a mistake to conduct such workouts on an ongoing basis. Over time, you can destroy your shoulder joint. By the way, your elbows will also thank you. \n\nGood luck!"

Which reminds me, I've met some people who just throw a couple shoulder exercises into their chest/back/legs/whatever instead of giving shoulders their own day. The shoulders may be small in relation to some other major muscle groups but as you can see there are three different heads of the shoulder. This means that there are three completely different types of movements you need to do. Shoulders deserve their own day. Often my shoulder/traps days last longer than any other muscle groups. "

You start a stopwatch from 0:00, for the start of that minute, you do an exercise for however many reps you like. The remainder of that minute will be your rest. At the start of the next minute, you'll do the same for another exercise, so on and so forth. \n\nSay you want to work upper body on Monday using EMOM. We'll use 3 movements for example:\n1. Push-ups \n2. Curls\n3. Dips (using a chair)\n\nStart a timer at 0:00. Let's say we want to do 5 reps for each exercise. The first minute, I'll do 5 push-ups, rest the remainder of that minute. The 2nd minute, I'll do 5 curls and rest the remainder of that minute, and the 3rd minute I'll do the same for dips. Once you've completed each exercise for the 3 minutes, do it over again. \n\nThis is a great format for exercise and can be used in numerous ways to benefit anyone. \n\nBy looking at the exercises you have already been doing, here is an example routine that I might use: (This is just my opinion, I'm not telling you to just drop everything and do this alone, but I'm trying to give some knowledge that I've learned from years of lifting)\n\nMonday: Upper Body EMOM\n1st min: Push-ups x5-8\n2nd min: Curls x5-8\n3rd min: Dips x5-8\n\n^^^ This is Round 1. Do 3 to 5 rounds. Which would be 9 to 15 minutes long depending on how many rounds.\n\nTuesday: Core EMOM\n1st min: Crunches x8-12\n2nd min: Plank 30 sec.\n3rd min: Side plank (Right) 30 sec.\n4th min: Side plank (Left) 30 sec.\n\n^^^ That's round 1. Do 2 to 4 rounds. Which would be 8 to 16 minutes depending on how many rounds.\n\nWednesday: Lower body EMOM\n1st min: Squats x5-10\n2nd min: Lunges x5-10 (each side)\n3rd min: Wall sit 30 sec.\n\n^^^ That's round 1. Do 3 to 5 rounds which would 9 to 15 minutes depending on how many rounds.\n\nThursday: Same as Monday\nFriday: Same as Tuesday\nSaturday: Same as Wednesday \n\n** There are many other ways to choose which days to do these on but this is my preferred favorite. I always like to work the same muscle twice a week to get the best of it. Say you wanted to work the muscles once a week, then you could use something like this:\n\nMonday: Upper body EMOM\nWednesday: Core EMOM\nFriday: Lower body EMOM\n\nThis is just some of my ideas and opinions of what I like to do in these kind of situations. I hope you gained something from this and best of luck to ya! God bless!"

Working out at the gym is only a fraction of what it takes to grow. You also need to eat. Eat a lot. Eat right. Eat clean. \n4. Eating and working out still isn't everything. You need to rest. Sleep is where you build the most muscle. You need to take days off.\n5. Don't buy into the hype of supplements. All you really need is maybe a protein shake and maybe creatine. Everything else is questionable. If you need a little energy before a workout then maybe a pre workout supplement.\n6. Finally, what program should you do?  \"Fierce Five\" is an excellent novice program https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=159678631 - it incorporates compound lifts (lifts requiring multiplies muscle groups) and will help get you strong and on your way to some quality gains.\n\nHope that helps and best of luck man."

I'd  suggest 4 sets of 5 or 6 reps but with a heavier weight because if you are doing heavier reps you will build muscle a lot faster. When ever you use supplements there should usually be a chart on the back that will show a list of weights so with your weight you'd just find it before hand and then go from there about how much you should mix up. Whenever you take it depending on the supplement you should either do it a little bit before you workout or if it's a recovery supplement then do it immediately after you're done. I hope that helps you man. \nAlso eat a bunch foods like peanut butter, and turkey stuff high in protein will make you build muscle a lot faster."

  "text": "That is very possible. I'm not in anyway able to discern wether or not it could hurt you but doing to much weight will stunt your growth. The only reason I know people to do less weight with more reps is to work those muscles into a toned kind or glamour way so they look good and there's nothing wrong with that in any way it's however you want to lift. You don't want to start out doing i.e. 150 pounds because your body won't be ready for it. It's better to do a day where you max out as in go from a low weight to the point where you top out and go from there. So say your max is 100 pounds you'd do 60% then 65% then 70% then 75% and once you've done it to where that 60% isn't hard you move up to 80%. If you're 15 I'd suggest not doing tons of weight cause it could stunt your growth. "
 },
 {
  "text": "You're young, so, I wouldn't really recommend supplements. Just eat more foods that are high in protein. When you hit maybe 18 or so, then maybe start doing some protein shakes.\n\nAdditionally, typically high reps is used for toning out. However, since you're a beginning, you're going to see the gains regardless. I'd dial that down, if you're looking for just a large size, to maybe something like 8 reps. I'm personally not a huge fan of doing it too little.\n\nYou can make 8 Reps on 60 Lbs feel like 12 Reps on 60 lbs too. Take longer to go down, slow the whole process down, and you'll get better gains that way.\n\nOf course, make sure you're doing it with proper form. You're beginning now, so if you do things from the beginning the proper way, it'll be a lot better for you in the future.\n\nGood luck!"

  "text": "Hello! First of all I noticed a controversial moment in your training program that could lead you to a plateau state. I suggest you change the pairs of muscle groups in your workouts. You can try to train the antagonists in the same workout. I think shoulder and abs are not the best combination at all. Shoulders should be combined with a large muscle group for a sufficient amount of anabolic growth factors. Lower back and Legs in the same workout can create too much stress for the nervous system and muscles. It seems to me quite likely that you just do not have enough time to fully recover. This may be the main reason for the onset of the plateau.\n\nHeavy working weights with low reps can create more anabolic factors for the growth of your muscles. On the other hand, a small number of repetitions will not allow you to use all the muscle mass muscle and fully load the muscle group. Based on this it is necessary to combine force approaches with high reps mid-amplitude approaches.\n\nIn general the number of reps doesn`t make any difference for experienced athlete. It is important to learn how to load the target muscle for a certain time which is allocated to the approach.\n\nGood Luck!"

Jumping into 500 lbs with little previous experience could lead to permanent tendon damage if things were to go wrong and that weight became unmanageable. \n\nI am used to seeing squats over 300 lbs done over an open floor so the weights can bounce if you have to let go, that squat bench or bar isn't going to be happy to have 500 lbs dropped on it.\n\nThat being said, you are a strong dude to be able to even shoulder 500 lbs, practice great form and you'll be a monster. 😎👍"

I lift heavy (\"heavy\" is a bit subjective and it's based on experience level, gender, etc. but you can find tables online that give you averages to work for). I'm female, so I don't have the testosterone to build much bulk or to build muscle quickly but I still manage at a slow and steady pace. Am I right to assume you're male? I've just never found anything better than the old-fashioned lifting heavy things up, putting them down and lifting them up again."

  "text": "It almost certainly would negate the calories you worked off.  You can check out MyFitnessPal for free to see how many calories are in different foods and drinks: they have a lot of brand names listed.\n\nI strongly second the protein recommendation SushiJuice gave you: apart from helping to build lean muscle, having protein after your workout will most likely also help curb excessive hunger, whereas eating or drinking things that are high in refined carbohydrates may very well increase your hunger.\n\nCarbohydrates can help you get through workouts if you drink/eat them before your workout (especially if they're long and hard workouts) because they're your body's go-to source of easy energy.  Mountain Dew would work in theory, but Mountain Dew is pretty high in refined sugar and low in micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) so (just being honest) almost anything would be a healthier choice if you're concerned about health and not just weight loss.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, remember the saying that \"You can't outrun a bad diet.\" Maintaining a healthy weight is mostly about eating well and less about working out.  Exercise will help you feel strong and healthy though, so it's still very worthwhile from that point of view."

  "text": "A bench and barbells with weight plates is a very good place to start and you could also add bodyweight exercises to help things along: I started with dumbbells and some small plates.\n\nIf you're a beginner or nearly a beginner, you don't have to worry too much about an overly refined plan: in fact, this is probably a good time to learn about your strengths and weaknesses and what sort of lifts you do well with.  This is pretty broad but you might like to do a basic push-pull-legs split.  Not sure how familiar you are, but that loosely means you work chest-triceps-shoulders (push motions) one day; back and biceps (pull motions) another day; and leg exercises on another day.  If you're up for it, that means you can work each muscles/muscle group twice a week, which will give you a rounded workout and make sure you're not overworking any one muscle group.\n\nIf I understand where you're at correctly, at this point one of the biggest things will be sheer consistency. At the beginning of trying to get back into shape, I noodled around with weights a couple of times a week. Even that helped since I was starting from zero, but now I exercise/lift six days a week and the gains are exponential.\n\nThere are also a ton of YouTube videos out there talking about different plans and demonstrating proper form on lots of exercises.  Those are helpful resources if you're working from home."

So far I've been adjusting my stance to plant my right foot very, *very* slightly ahead of my left (I think this compensates for the corkscrewing and, oddly, puts my pelvis on a straight plane) but I know this isn't a great permanent solution.\n\nI haven't tried a lift because my balance isn't great and I think I'd have a hard time without being able to feel my feet planted firmly on the ground.

Considering my age and weight (which is 161 and I'm 6'1), do I need to consume that much each day or can I conserve more of it and make it last for the next month or so?\n\nI'm a bit confused about this: is this factoring in dietary sources of protein? Because that seems like a lot if it's in addition to dietary sources of protein even for your gender, size and activity level.\n\n&gt; Assuming I spend 3-4 hours a week working out in the gym and apply the PP properly, approximately within how much time should I expect to see some progress or see an increase in muscle mass whether during a work out or visible gains?\n\nDepends on a lot of factors. You probably already have some muscular development from sports, so you're not quite a novice and wouldn't gain like an unfit beginner would.  Also, it sounds as though you're very active in high aerobic activities and I'd wonder if that might work against gains to some degree. I also wonder about overtraining.

Here's a starter article: \n\n[Will Cardio Keep Me from Gaining Muscle?]\n(http://www.menshealth.com/fitness/will-cardio-keep-me-from-gaining-muscle)\n\nI guess my general recommendation would be to try to get as much lean protein from your diet as is possible and convenient (though it sounds like you're a good candidate for PP all things considered).  I can't recommend creatine monohydrate (a very affordable amino acid (cheaper than even the cheapest PPs)) since I don't know much about how it might affect young people under 18, but many of us use it and it helps.  You definitely don't have to go crazy with supplements or even use them at all but PP, basic creatine monohydrate and BCAAs (sometimes, depending on your needs) are pretty standard/common.  Do you have a coach or team sports doctors who might be willing to sit down and talk with you about these things?  I think coaches (and team sports doctors) are the best resources since they know you and your specific needs as an athlete best."

You need to do things that reduce overall fat.  No amount of crunches will help you.\n\nBelly fat is usually a result of elevated cortisol and stress.  It's suggested that it's an evolutionary tactic - your body perceives stress and builds up belly fat to protect the organs. \n Some basic things to do is to minimize this\n\n1. Eat a balanced diet including 8 servings of vegetables daily - preferably calciferous vegetables including kale, cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower.  Get a meal tracker app (like MyFitnessPal - it sets calorie goals based on your goals and lifestyle) and track everything you stuff into your face.  Ideally, you want to lose a pound or two of body fat per week (initially, you may lose more due to water weight).\n2.  Do some full-body resistance training that incorporates compound lifts (bench press, squat, and deadlift).  Use progressive overload to increase strength over time (increase weight and/or reps each week).  I'd strongly suggest something like fierce 5 novice program https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931\n3.  Meditate or pray - to reduce your stress.\n4.  Be sure to be getting a good 8-9 hours of sleep each day.\n5.  Do some low intensity cardio daily (walk for 20 minutes).  Don't think running 5 miles will help - it could actually increase stress levels and cortisol...\n\nAlso, figure out what kind of belly fat you have.  If you can easily pinch an inch or so of it, it's subcutaneous fat (in your lower layers of skin) which isn't that bad.  If your gut is hard, and you can't really pinch it, it's more likely visceral fat - fat beneath your ab muscles surrounding your organs.  This is more problematic and tends to increase chances of diabetes.  If you have visceral fat, try to take milk thistle - it helps with liver fat...\n\nHope that helps..."

On your back/bicep day, be sure to include pull-ups - these stimulate your CNS (Central Nervous System) greatly... When doing curls, be sure to go all the way down and feel that stretch in the bicep - that's critical.  Also, be sure to do a hammer curl to stimulate the short head of the bicep and the brachialis which helps with the \"peak\" or ball...  On your days off, be sure to stretch you biceps - this is a much avoided technique to increase size...\n\nAlso, as u/pelayogilberto states - go heavy and do 3 or 5 set of 4-6 reps...  but over all, you shouldn't do more than 15-20 sets per week on biceps...  I'd also suggest not doing splits like you're doing - they're great for 'enhanced' lifters, but for naturals, I'd suggest a full body workout... I have examples if you're interested..."

  "text": "If you want to \"lose weight and tone\" then you must understand how does it work. During your workout you expend your energy reserves. During your rest period, these reserves are replenished from the glycogen that is stored in your liver and muscles. Glycogen stores are replenished mainly from carbohydrate food, so carbohydrates directly affect your energetics, strength and mental potential. If the glycogenic depots are depleted and do not replenish for a certain time, then the body will use alternative sources of energy, such as subcutaneous fat. From this it follows that your main task is to deplete glycogen reserves as quickly as possible and not to replenish their certain amount of time in order to create conditions for using subcutaneous fat as energy. \n\nSo If you are not satisfied with your current form, then you definitely should gradually increase your training loads. This does not necessarily have to be a \"cardio\" workout, rather the opposite. High-intensity, interval cardio loads first of all overload your heart and do not deplete glycogen stores in muscles. Such trainings are aimed at the development of endurance and do not directly affect the fat burning processes. Yes, they are certainly useful in reasonable quantities, since the development of endurance is an indispensable factor in your progress in strength training and general state of health.\n\nSorry for my English and Good luck!"

 {
  "text": "I will try to give an example of the correct combination of cardio and strength training.\nImagine that you have 5 workouts a week with approximately the same load and intensity level.  We will assume that they occur in the evening. We assume that you use the principle of protein-carbohydrate alternation in your diet and on Wednesday you have \"carbohydrate loading\". On the first day you perform a light jog in the morning, the next day the duration of the jogging increases, and on the third day the intensity also increases. On the 4th day you repeat the second day, and on the 5th - 1st day. Then you have 2 rest days, but you need an active rest. So I reccomend some hiking in a fresh air. 5-10 miles will be enough. Thus, a week cycle is obtained, in which cardio, power loads and rest are balanced due to different duration and intensity of loads.\n\nThis is just an example. You need to spend a little time on self-study to better understand exactly how the recovery processes take place in your body and choose the best option for yourself. \n\n"

  "text": "Dumbbell presses are the best in my opinion. Start with flat bench, then incline, then decline. The difference is you press up starting wider than shoulders but finish the move with your hands directly over your chest. That squeezing motion is key. \n\nSets:\nChoose a weight you can press 12 times for the first set. Count slowly, 2 seconds up and 2 seconds down. Rest for 2 or 3 minutes to allow the blood to rush to your chest. Move up 5lbs for the second (rest) and third set of  12 reps. Rest. Go back to the original weight for the 4th set. \n\nThis is a combination of weight lifting and time lifting. Finding the balance between how much you can lift (in good form) for over 45 seconds for each set of 12 reps. \n\nSimply, 4 seconds per rep x 12 reps = 48 seconds \n\nI guarantee you’ll feel it within a day or so after doing this.

  "text": "I would suggest focusing on building muscle first. Here is why:\n-It's easier to build muscle when you have a higher body fat percentage. The more weight your body has to carry around the more likely it will hold onto muscle to carry that weight. Also, having more fat lubricates the joints and provides a more stable base. This will allow you to lift heavier which leads to more muscle gain. \n-It's easier to lose weight when you have muscle. Muscle is metabolically expensive. This means that the more you have, the faster your metabolism will be. This will make it easier to lose weight in the long run.\n-Being a little overweight with a muscular frame looks better than skinny fat. Muscle is what gives your body shape and what makes it look good. If you put on the muscle first you will look good throughout the entire cutting process. If you cut the fat first and then put muscle on later you won't look really good until you put the muscle on later which is further down the line. I'd also like to add that most people I know who have cut first were too scared to put the muscle on later in fear that they will get fat again. \n\nThe only reason I would suggest prioritizing fat loss over building muscle first is if you have serious health issues that need to be dealt with immediately. "
 },
 {
  "text": "Fat loss is going to come with your diet. You need to have a slight deficit in calories consumed verses what your burning. Weight training helps you build muscle, the more muscle you have the more calories you burn naturally. Cardio helps burn more calories in combination with weight training so I would say keep doing your workouts with cardio but focus on your nutrition to help lose fat."

  "text": "Well what you have is the split and it looks good (or it is very likely good enough). \n\nHowever, this is only one part of a good program and probably not the most important part. \n\nI highly recommend watching Dr. Israetel’s intro to hypertrophy (he have intro video on YouTube under Revive Stronger podcast).\n\nThe first key is specificity - do you want strength or size. You mentioned hypertrophy so you are going with the latter; for size, the key is volume (weight x rep x set).  How munch volume are you doing? For beginner maybe start with 10 or 12 set a week per major muscle group (chest, lats, back, quads, glutes) and see how you do.\n\nThe second key missing element is overload. Are you doing heavy enough? Research shows the minimum effective load is anything above 60% of your one rep max (1RM).\n\nThe third key is progressive overload. You can just go bust your ass giving your max every time - it is subpar but not because the stimulus is too strong but because you cannot sustain long (it takes time to gain, though it is much faster for beginner). Also, it increases risk of injury. The best way is to do the minimum volume for you to grow but you add more (more weight, more reps, more sets or a combination) each week. (You absolutely must keep track of your workouts; take a notebook or use your phone) In this way you can milk the gains for weeks and weeks and you get stronger and bigger without burn out prematurely. You push a bit harder each week until you are near max or a bit beyond (overreach); then you deload for a week to reset, rest and recover. Usually this happens after 4-7 weeks of progressive overload when you have accumulated too much fatigue. Ppl say beginner can do longer but it depends on your starting volume, overload size, ongoing intensity, stress in life etc. I highly recommend research that too cos the GAINs come from rest and recovery. After this, you repeat the process and start a new mesocycle.\n\nAnother point is periodization. It is perhaps not relevant to you now but you can look into it. Basically muscles get used to stimulus over time and growth slows; one way to overcome is to change the stimulus a little after some time (say two cycles). You can change the exercise, the grip, the tempo etc. this is not key for your level now (Maybe after 6m you can try)\n\nFinally, nutrition. If you do the above correct, it would be a waste if you don’t take full advantage to grow by not taking enough calories and/or the right nutrients. For growth, you want to eat a bit more (say 300- 500 calories more each day) to fuel the growth. Don’t worry about fat. If you eat clean (no junk, refined carb or booze etc), you won’t put on much fat. Also, eat good quality protein (pp recommend 1g per lb of body weight); make sure at least half of your protein is from good source like meat/fish/dairy/protein powder. There are a lot of good resources online for nutrition during lean bulking. \n\nThis is what the pros recommend; online a lot of pp will tell you beginners can do anything and they will grow and it is true but you harvest more gains (and less risk of injury) by doing it proper and it also gives you better foundation to grow longer term. It is quite process driven and methodical. \n\nGood luck!\n"

Try not to focus on belly fat specifically and focus on reducing your body fat percentage. As for the muscle milk you'd probably be better off drinking it post workout instead of mid. Your body only has so much blood. If it has to send blood to the digestive muscles  mid workout that's taking away from the amount of blood it can send to the muscles you're working and it will hamper your workout. I don't have any flavor suggestions for you because I personally think all muscle milk tastes terrible. "

You won’t see results of really any REAL workout plan for at least 6 weeks, so before you start working out you need to know you won’t wake up next week 20 pounds heavier with a six pack.

Pick 4 or 5 workouts targeting your leg areas, like barbell squats, Romanian deadlifts, leg press machine, some sort of lunges with weights. Do 3-5 sets of 10 reps, when you're finished commit to doing at least 10 mins of cardio. I usually split running on a treadmill and doing jumping jacks, mountain climbers back to back for a few mins. This usually takes me about 40 mins depending on how long of a break I need in between some of he harder sets.\nFor abs, the BEST workout I just started doing that burns the shit out of my lower stomach are leg lifts with a yoga ball.

  "text": "Here's the full text from the blog post:\n\n&gt; I remember the days when I was so fit that a sports injury was always looming but it was only temporary. My fitness and wellness aided and accelerated my recovery every time–even if it took just a little help from a doc or surgeon. \n\n&gt; As someone who’s super-size and who needs to lose ~100 pounds–someone who wants to get back into a delicate rowing single shell that demands a much thinner frame–I have been getting quite a few more incidental sedentary injuries–injuries that seem, so far, to be random and annoying but might be trending towards being chronic and a premature sign of aging.   \n\n&gt; Lots of people call what I am suffering form is called the sedentary lifestyle or, more recently, the sitting disease. \n\n&gt; I write this blog because I am fatter than fit and more sedentary than active. My athletic life used to be about getting as much performance out of my body between sports injuries; now, however, in my heavy weight and limited mobility, fitness, and strength, it’s now about getting as much performance out of my body between sedentary injuries.\n\n&gt; For me, sedentary injuries are defined as those awful debilitating things that happen when I’m doing absolutely nothing at all.\n\n&gt; For example, a sitting injury in my hip or sciatica, a standing injury including an aching lumbago, a sleeping injury in the form of of a pinched nerve in my neck; or, the worst, a lower-back pinch. Sometimes I’ll even get a sore hip just from sleeping on my side.\n\n&gt; Oy vey ist mir!\n\n&gt; Speaking of sitting injuries that can easily be prevented from an active lifestyle is hemorrhoids. Last month while sleeping, I pinched a nerve in my lower back. I took some days off from erging on my Concept2 indoor rower to allow the muscle spasm in my back to release.\n\n&gt; Once that happened, I was about to jump back onto my treadmill desk and my Concept2 and even swing my kettlebell and, all of a sudden, I got my very first serious attack of the hemorrhoids. Yes, the piles!\n\n&gt; They grounded me and made me feel more desperate, blue, dark, and depressed as I’ve ever been from an injury. I was in inconsolable pain for a couple weeks, the sort of discomfort that isn’t just worked out on its own from walking it off or even from a nice walk on my treadmill desk. Now I am thoroughly stocked with various and sundry Preparation H products and wipes and, again, so grateful, as always, to A+D Ointment.\n\n&gt; Now that I am well again and all these sundry humiliating bottom, bum, back, and neck pains are dormant, I need to take this time to get profoundly in shape. Being extremely fit as a baseline is essential.\n\n&gt; Having a default of strength, health, fitness, and leanness means that there’s a much better chance that my strong core, strong abdominal floor, strong legs, glutes, quads, back and neck will be able to better stabilize my skeleton, spine, neck, and scull, actively preventing chronic sedentary issues such as: neck cricks, hemorrhoids, sciatica, and even: oy, my lumbago!\n\n&gt; Warning:\n\n&gt; Ok, here’s the rub. As you and I progress from couch potato to athlete, there’s a danger zone between the two, when you’re not fit or strong enough to support a hard core, when you’re vulnerable: you’re still sedentary so all of your new athleticism will put quite a strain on you.\n\n&gt; Take it easy and spend a lot of time stretching after working out and between sets. Mobility and flexibility are earned and not a given.  When I jumped into swinging my kettlebell for 90-seconds every hour, I didn’t remotely stretch enough after each set and at the end of the day. \n\n&gt; 2016 Four Courts Four Miler produced by Pacers Running. Photo by Brian W. Knight/Swim Bike Run Photo.What happened after putting this extra stress on my body, out of nowhere, is a real pain in my ass: both lower back pain and sciatica.\n\n&gt; Luckily, I bought myself a bunch of massage sticks and foam rollers and was able to calm down the inflammation leading to the pinch but it would surely have been better if I prevented it all by making sure I spent a good ten minutes slowly warming up and then some serious time stretching and working on my mobility and flexibility.\n\n&gt; So, just make sure you don’t swing your kettlebells without stretching your body–learn from my mistakes! Learn from me! I don’t want else anyone to ever have hemorrhoids flare ups if they–you–don’t have to.\n\nI seriously hope you like it -- it ain't easy at all!"

In this case, you can try the principle of protein-carbohydrate alternation in your nutrition plan. \n\nIf you have a priority in increasing muscle mass and strength, then the training should be based primarily on the basic movements of powerlifting and weightlifting. In this case, it is better not to exclude carbohydrates from food, but concentrate on the selection of quality products. A sufficient amount of the animal protein of emergence, unsaturated fats and whole grains will provide you with the necessary energy and recovery.\n\nYou should spend some time studying the training principle that interests you and the fundamentals of metabolic processes, so that you can correctly formulate a training program and optimally adjust your nutrition plan.

Yes that's a good sign in this diet lmao. But if you can stick with it, it will shred body fat like a machine, but it's hard so you gotta stick with It!

  "text": "Shin splints are actually what happen when the muscle in the front of the shin gets overworked. When you land that muscle performs an eccentric contraction to absorb the shock of the impact. It’s a very small muscle and even though it is built solely for endurance it does wear. If you’re having problem with shin splints the most likely cause is overuse/overtraining (yes despite what CT Fletcher might tell you overtraining does exist). The result if you continue to push through this pain are muscle/ligament tears and potentially even hairline fracture of the tibia. While controlling variables like shoes/running surfaces can help with shin splints proper programming is the best answer. You need to give those muscles more rest and scale back your running program. If your shins are what are limiting you then you have to design your progression around how much you can do without them hurting. Cross training is another good way to work around overuse injuries like shin splints. You can do other modes of cardio like biking or the elliptical to build up your cardiovascular ability without blowing your shins out. "

It is very important to do self-learning about training and nutrition to build muscle, but you will save a huge amount of time if you are helped by a good trainer. Define for yourself some specific goals, think what was the reason to start training to increase your strength and muscle mass and then you can choose the right direction with the specialist. Follow the technique of doing the exercises and focus on the muscular sensation, this is the most important thing in the construction of muscle mass. Once in 2-3 months, change the training program, and determine the future goals. You must establish friendly relations with regular visitors, learn and exchange the extracted knowledge and experience and you will succeed. Good Luck!"

It's also a good idea to stretch the muscle for a few seconds after completing a series of sets in exercise.

Think about your muscles like a rubber band. As they become stronger the band becomes more condense and tight.

Within your first year or two of consistently working out you probably won’t feel any negative effects of not stretching. But over time it accumulates and you’ll feel it even worse later on. "

  "text": "I can advise you training with kettlebells. First of all, learn how to perform kettlebell snatch. This exercise will help you develop explosive strength and endurance. It involves most large muscle groups and develops a neuromuscular connection between them. With this movement, you will also develop mobility of the waist, strengthen the knee and shoulder joints. \n\nThe second important movement for you is kettlebell swings. Here, the main emphasis will be on the back of the thigh and lower back. This movement perfectly develops the skills of jumping. \n\nKettlebell is a very convenient and less traumatic projectile than most other free weights. Kettlebell is an excellent alternative to classic dumbbells, with a lot of advantages. I recommend to try it personally in order to understand the effectiveness of training with weights. Good luck!"

You just need to soberly assess the need and the personal norm. If you are not preparing for competition, everything is in order with your health, then I think you can occasionally afford to drink a little. You need to strive for harmony with yourself, sometimes make yourself some nice gifts to which you can include alcohol. I have been training for many years and I understand that sometimes the nervous system does not stand a constant strict regime, so sometimes you have to create certain conditions to \"reset\" your emotional state.

I propose to try long walks from 10 km, every day or every other day at an average tempo in the fresh air. Theoretically, your body must adapt to this kind of load, and large volumes of legs will prevent you from constantly overcoming long distances without rest. I can not be sure of this at 100%, but it's definitely worth trying. Good luck!"

It comes into play during bench press, rows, deadlifts, push-ups and basically any upper body involved exercise.  So, it is important to keep them strong and healthy or in the case of injury to rehab properly.\nThis video will focus on resistance band and dumbbell variations that you can implement yourself!  \nIf you like this tutorial make sure to like, comment and subscribe down below so you can view the weekly fitness, tips tutorials and discussions!\nIf you feel like I left something out or need further clarification on constructive criticism is always welcomed!\n"

My biggest change was the amount of pasta/rice I was eating, and snacks. I started weighing everything I ate and tried to keep the pasta to about 75 grams at lunch and 50 at dinner, meat 100 g and vegetables (whatever amount), then instead of eating cookies or lots of bread with butter, I now stick to fruit, plain yogurt with honey or whole wheat bread with ham. Also if you start exercising you should eat every 2-3 hours and ingest protein in every meal you consume. When it comes to workout, just go to bodybuilding.com or even this subreddit and you will find specific plans! If you wanna do it at home having one of those elastic bands (not sure how to call it), a pull-up bar and some dumbbells is essential, but again LOOK FOR A WORKOUT, doing random exercises isn't gonna cut it. Also for more information look up AthleanX on YouTube and make sure to write some of the info on his videos. Hope this helps! "

If you don’t like eggs, you can always get the powdered egg whites but i’d just suck it up and start eating them(decent protein and a ton of other nutrients).Second, if you don’t want to go to the gym for whatever reason, you can use body weight exercises such as pushups/pull-ups to build some size/definition. I’d also at least invest in some adjustable dumbbells that go up to at least 30 per. I’m also a massive supporter of supplements(at least protein powder so you can make sure you’re getting enough in your daily diet).In saying that, I would recommend getting a gym membership for multiple reasons. There’s nothing wrong with lifting alone, I lift solo all the time. Also, you can see who knows what they’re doing and what exercises are the most efficient. The “golden three” are bench, deadlift, and squats but you need to develop some sort of split which you can find really anywhere online nowadays. And who knows, you might meet someone cool who is also looking for a lifting partner that can help you reach your goals and become the aesthetic god inside of you.

It is important to create the right conditions for the transformation of the body, to enhance overall endurance and performance. It is important not to allow the adaptation of your body and continuously to find opportunities to increase the overall volume of anabolic factors. To do this, it is necessary to increase the volume of muscle mass, maintain the health of the nervous, digestive and cardio systems of the body, ensure the proper hormonal and water-salt balance, get enough oxygen daily, find ways and the ability to rest. Only on the way to the ideal health and functioning of your body can you find your personal ideal body. IMHO"

I would focus on stretching! Older with age the more important the stretch. I worked out for 20 years and stretching is an exercise in it self n I put it above lifting...just my opinion! Contra lateral leg raises, core strengthening and body weight exercises like deadlift with no to little weight, walking lunges etc. train for the life you live, you don't need to train like a beast! I know it's cool to train hard go beast mode when I was young, and looking like a Greek statue, now it's about being limber, maintaining strength and being content. Rest a week, and remember that your trainer is trying to keep his job n if he make you work hard then you will think he is doing his job, he need to learn that the job is you body. Sometimes he needs to give to you hard, but has to know when to slow down and listen to your body and adjust his grind to dance with your rhythm."

Breathing is definitely something you should concentrate on.

  "text": "Honestly I can not understand what your problem is. You do not need to focus on some app instruction in order to understand the amount of calories you need. \n\nStart each day with a full breakfast. It should be rich in complex carbohydrates, easily digestible proteins, vitamins and minerals. \nFor lunch, you need to eat a double portion of complex carbohydrates. \n\nAnd for dinner you need to eat a double portion of protein food. Also, add enough fat for dinner.\n\n An excellent choice of complex carbohydrates will be: oatmeal, buckwheat, brown rice, whole wheat and rye flour bread. \nProtein products are also usually rich in fats. This is a natural combination of microelements which you should not be afraid of. The only recommendation is not to combine high-fat protein products and large portions of carbohydrates. \n\nDrink plenty of water. Drink more than you want. Minimum of a glass of water every hour.\n\nIn your workouts, use the basic strengths movements. Use predominantly free weights, and strive to constantly increase your working weights. \n\nIf you follow these recommendations, you can significantly increase your muscle volume and strength.

It is very important to do self-learning about training and nutrition to build muscle, but you will save a huge amount of time if you are helped by a good trainer. Define for yourself some specific goals, think what was the reason to start training to increase your strength and muscle mass and then you can choose the right direction with the specialist. Follow the technique of doing the exercises and focus on the muscular sensation, this is the most important thing in the construction of muscle mass.

But you also need to consider that in this mode you can not gain more muscle mass. Good luck!"

The diet should have enough protein and complex carbohydrates. You should choose low-fat food and add vegetable fats from nuts, seeds and oils. Chopping food for 4 or more meals can help you eat more. If the goal is also to get rid of the fat layer, then the last meal should contain a minimum amount of carbohydrates. In that case, you should take care of a nutritious breakfast the next day. You should also drink at least 2 liters of clean water every day. \n\nRemember that the most important thing is to adhere to a certain regime for one to two months after which you can evaluate the result and make the necessary adjustments in the nutrition and training program.

Set your goal (weight loss, gain muscle, bulk, etc) and then start counting everything you put into your body.  Including water.  Everything must be tracked, and luckily the age of technology makes this very easy.  But you must be diligent and you must be honest.  if you cheat, you're only cheating yourself.  \n\nSecond, start with low weight or body weight exercises until you feel comfortable working out.  Working out should never be \"comfortable,\" but you do need to acclimate your body.  r/fitness and r/bodyweightfitness are great places to find beginner routines.\n\nFinally, slow down a bit!  Realistically, 40-45 days may begin to show improvement, and you will definitely begin to feel better if you are diligent, but it is no where near enough time to give you substantial bodily change.  Also, if you push too hard, you can over train, you can injure, or you can burnout.  These three things will frustrate you, and then you will want to stop improving.\n\nFollow any of the subs that interest you for additional advice and motivation.\n\nGood luck and congrats!\n\n "

Your diet needs to be put in check. Stop eating anything that comes from a bag, box, or can. Get a meal tracking app to track what you stuff into your face. You need extra protein to pack on muscle (about 150g per day for you). You need to monitor your calorie intake. I suggest the MyFitnessPal app - it will set up calorie goals automatically based on your exercise level and lifestyle. Eat more leafy greens. Eat whole foods (meat, rice, vegetables, fruit)\n\n\n2.  Sleep better. You build muscle and burn fat in your sleep, not in a gym or running. Be sure to get 8-9 hours of sleep\n\n\n3.  Walk 20 minutes per day to help burn fat (running is not suggested if you want to build muscle). I'd suggest doing full body workouts.  Compound lifts (where multiple muscle groups are required - like Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift) Try the **Novice** version of Fierce 5 https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931\n\nBest of luck.

To do this, you need to closely monitor the technique of doing exercises. You must slow down the pace of the movement and make a peak reduction of at least 1 second. Watch out for the negative phase, constantly keep the tension in the working muscle group. Working weights should be moderate, but at the end of the approach you should clearly feel the numbness in the working muscle. This is the first indicator that you are doing everything right.

Take care of a balanced diet and a strong sleep. In this case, you probably do not need any sports supplements. If you feel that you do not get enough sleep and/or you do not have time to recover muscles and nervous system, you can add creatine, carnitine, glutamine and vitamin-mineral complex.

Control the negative phase of motion, make a peak contraction in the stretched position, work inside the amplitude. For this type of training, 1-2 warm-up and 3-4 working sets will be enough. \n\nAfter a week, at the next legs workout, try working in a range of 6-10 repetitions in squats and 5-8 reps in deadlifts. Your working weights in this case will be bigger, but the control of the implementation should also take a place. In this case there will be enough 2-3 warm-up and 2 working sets in each exercise.\n\nI hope this can help. Good luck!"

Artificial sweeteners are finiky and are starting to come out as causing lots of side effects (myself and a lot others have restless leg whenever I have it.... which blows). So I stopped all my artificial sweeteners except the small amount that's in my protein by default but it's stevia based. I can't stand stevia sweeteners but it's the best choice out there when picking a sweetener. Every morning I use flavored creamer in my coffee...it's the one thing I don't substitute and that's the best time to have your most sugar, then you have the rest of the day to burn it off. As to the amount....it's all about what kind of food you're eating instead of how much sugar. As long as you're putting in complex sugars and carbs you can afford to have a bit more...as they are naturally in the foods and not part of a processed group (like fruits). However....as a rule of thumb you want to keep the majority of your carbs and sugars in the first half of your day and move to your starches and protein in the evening (oatmeal is an exception). \n\nI wish I could give you an exact number of sugars but to be honest it's about what eating plan you're following. I teach all my clients about the modified 3 hour diet. for MOST people that are cutting I recommend eating 300 calories every 3 hours, 5 times a day. The amazing thing about this plan is it's not restricting of any food group in it's entirety (ofc we want only healthy fats and even then in moderation along with sugar). And once you've been on this eating plan for a week your body will tell you what it needs...it's truly amazing. After a workout I need carbs....so every day I make a banana chocolate oatmeal pancake with natural peanut butter...others are good with their shakes or even a huge chicken breast.

Not only are free-weights a much more natural movement, put you will nearly always work more muscles with free-weights, many stabilizer muscles and often core muscle that you would otherwise barely if at all stimulate with machines will be activated. I would highly recommend you incorporate free-weights in your workout routine, and then if you use machines, use them to finish off a muscle you're trying to isolate."

  "text": "Don’t worry about the reps/sets too much. Heavy weight will build strength. High volume will build endurance. Both will build size. The only two things that really matter are progressive overload and being in a caloric surplus. \n\nProgressive overload means that over time the intensity is increasing. It doesn’t matter if it’s volume, weight, or duration that you’re increasing. As long something is increasing while the other variables either stay the same or also increase. \n\nCaloric surplus just means that you’re taking in more calories than you’re using. If your weight isn’t going up then you’re not eating enough. It’s that simple. Weigh yourself every day and if after a week the weigh ins are still the same then you need to add more food to your diet. At your body weight you really don’t need to worry about eating super clean. Especially if you’re training hard and getting enough protein. Just eat whatever you can get down. A good tip here is you should never be hungry. If you’re hungry then you’re behind on your meals. "

  "text": "In order to maximally increase the volume of muscle mass, you need to perform complex movements. Exercises should involve the maximum amount of muscle fibers. This in turn will give the greatest response from your hormonal system. This, in turn, will create the most favorable conditions for the growth of muscle mass. And in order for it to work and give the necessary effect, you need to eat right, rest and sleep between your workouts. \n\nI can recommend the following exercises: squats, deadlifts, army presses,  pull ups, bench presses, kbell/barbell snatch, kbell/barbell clean (clean + jerk), bent-over barbell row. You can only perform these exercises and progress well in your strenghts and muscle volumes. \n\nThe most important thing is to stick to the regime of the day, exercise and nutrition. Only in this case you will get to correctly assess your progress and make the necessary corrections."

Usually simulators are used for the rehabilitation and/or isolation of a specific muscle group. But the problem lies in the fact that in any case you need to increase the volume of muscle mass in order to properly work out the isolated muscle. Also machines will be useful in conditions of a rigid diet and will help to work out the depth of muscles. If you have the opportunity to work with free weights, be sure to use it. Good luck!"

  "text": "(copied from another comment of mine) \n\nIt's important to understand fat in the stomach area and what TYPE of fat your have. \n\n1. **Subcutaneous Fat** - if you can pinch the fat and it's easy to grab, you have subcutaneous fat - fat on the outside of your abdominal wall under the skin.  This is relatively easy to shed.  Just eat more leafy greens, reduce calories, and do low impact cardio (walk 20 minutes per day).\n\n2.  **Visceral Fat** - If you can't pinch the fat in your stomach area, and it's hard, you have visceral fat.  This is more of an issue and could lead to more problems down the road such as hormonal imbalances and diabetes.  This fat lies under your abdominal wall and is surrounding your organs.  This requires more attention than some diet and cardio.  Do everything as above, but also minimize or eliminate alcohol/drugs, get deep restful 8-9 hours of sleep each day, and learn to meditate and reduce stress in your life (visceral fat is often caused by elevated cortisol levels (stress hormones)...\n\nHope that helps..."

 {
  "text": "(Below is copied my comment from another post)\n\nYou'll need to look at this as a 3 piece puzzle.\n\n1.  Your diet needs to be put in check. Stop eating anything that comes from a bag, box, or can. Get a meal tracking app to track what you stuff into your face. You need extra protein to pack on muscle. You need to monitor your calorie intake. I suggest the MyFitnessPal app - it will set up calorie goals automatically based on your exercise level and lifestyle. Eat more leafy greens. Eat whole foods (meat, rice, vegetables, fruit)\n\n\n2.  Sleep better. You build muscle and burn fat in your sleep, not in a gym or running. Be sure to get 8-9 hours of sleep\n\n\n3.  Walk 20 minutes per day to help burn fat (running is not suggested if you want to build muscle). I'd suggest doing full body workouts.  Compound lifts (where multiple muscle groups are required - like Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift) Try the **Novice** version of Fierce 5 https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931\n\nBest of luck. Remember, this is not a race. The most results will occur over the first 12 months of this. Building sizable muscle will take years, but keep at it.  Hope that helps..."

  "text": "This is the one thing most people trying to lose weight forget: it takes a while. \n\nAn example (this is what I’m doing myself):\n\nI’m ~6’1” and supposedly burn 2000 calories everyday naturally. \n\nI’ve reduced my caloric intake to ~1500 a day so there *should* be a 500 calorie deficit which means that my body will use those calories for fuel, which in turn means I’ll be burning calories that I don’t replace. \n\nThis is the basis of losing weight. We all know this. \n\nNow, to lose 1 pound of fat you must burn ~3500 calories. If I’m at a caloric deficit of 500 a day then it will take 7 days to lose that pound. From here it’s just basic math:\n\nIf you want to lose 10 pounds it will take 70 days, which is ~2 months and 10 days. \n\nHere’s what I’ve done for the past 2 months and it’s worked well:\n\nLimit alcohol consumption to once every 2 weeks. Have a few beers or glasses of wine. \n\nGo to the gym ~5 times a week and get your heart rate up over 130 for 30 minutes each time. Then lift weights like this: \n1. First set, low weight for 20 reps\n2. Second set raise weight so you can do 12-15 reps\n3. Third set raise the weight so you can do 8 reps\n4. Forth set drop the current weight in half and stop counting reps. Just do them with good form until the burn gets too uncomfortable\n\nBased on this routine you should burn between 450 and 550 calories each time which is roughly an extra 2,450 calories a week. \n\nSo, to add it all up... Burning 850 calories a day (500 deficit plus 350 workout) will lose that 10 pounds in ~40 days, and you’ll be growing your muscles at the same time which will in turn make you look more cut. "

You're biceps should still be pretty sore that's why but changing to Tris helps them)\nThursday or Friday I do cardio and abs \nSaturday is shoulders.\n\nThe next week I'm changing it up, for instance hitting shoulders and upper back on the same day....and going chest with bis....etc.\n\nWell I'm not bashing your way of lifting.....if you're doing the exercises nice and slowly on the negative with the right form you shouldn't need to hit arms 3xs a week. It's not allowing them to properly breakdown and rebuild. Hope this helps"

He said this is a life time struggle.  And various foot exercises to build up the muscles in the front of my calf to also fight the back leg muscles.  If I skip exercises or stretching , I can feel it getting worse pretty quickly.\n\nWith my particular issues he said avoid running, standing around.  Walking was good.  \n\nHe said that the best cardio for me was the bike, as long as I was sitting. Or swimming.\n\n\nWhen i started out I saw him every 4 to 5 weeks ( thank goodness for insurance).

Do not rush to increase working weights in exercises, try to perform every movement under control. The pace of the exercises should be slow and medium with a pause in the shortened position. In any case, you should understand the main thing - the exercises must involve a large muscle mass and not isolate a small group. \n\nYou can try a simple diet for begining. Carbohydrate food, such as pasta, cereals, potatoes, bread in the first half of the day. For dinner from carbohydrates only stewed and fresh vegetables. Chicken and red meat, white and red fish, whole eggs, white cheese are excellent sources of protein for you. \n\nYour progress will depend entirely on how seriously you will adhere to the chosen diet, exercise and rest. After a month or two, you will be able to evaluate your results, make the necessary adjustments and outline your future goals. Good luck!\n\n"

If this is not possible then perform them after every strength training 2-3 approaches to max. \n \nI hope this will be useful!"

Concentrate on the selection of quality products. An excellent choice of complex carbohydrates will be: oatmeal, buckwheat, brown rice, whole wheat and rye flour bread. Protein products are also usually rich in fats. This is a natural combination of microelements which you should not be afraid of. The only recommendation is not to combine high-fat protein products and large portions of carbohydrates. You must choose a diet that you can really adhere to. \n\nDrink plenty of water. Drink more than you want! \n\nAdd some strengths workout in the morning. These can be push-ups, squats, pull-ups etc. Do some training activity each day. You need to make some progression on each movement. This is really important to change your body. And keep walking! Take it as a test and try to get satisfaction and pleasure from the work done.

Usually (not all of the time) when people say that they mean they don’t have the time with how they currently go about their day. Meaning they don’t want to sacrifice 30 min of sleep, or 30 min of TV, or 30 min of quiet time in the morning. When it becomes a big enough priority you will find the time. That being said, I agree with the response above about abs being made in the kitchen, not the gym."

Also, consider the fact that there are world class bodybuilders who are vegan, so not only do you not need fast food, but you can accomplish all of your lifting goals without meat or dairy. I don’t, because those are the two greatest foods on the planet, but nobody can make an argument why we absolutely need them. \n\nAlso, I switched from whey protein to plant based protein and I love the results.

Vary the range of repetitions and the time the muscles work under load. It seems to me, based on personal experience, that the most effective exercises are pull-ups with reverse grip and hummer curls with kettlebell or other free weight with one center of gravity. It is also very important to monitor the grip, do not squeeze your palms too much, try to remove the load from your forearm. Hope this can help!"

It is important to clearly understand that your body is in a stage of active growth, therefore it is very important to develop body harmoniously during this period, it will help to avoid injuries and will increase your potential in any kind of sport. I did not have experience of training with such young athletes, but I'm sure that the emphasis should be shifted to the development of coordination and strengthening of the your bone-ligament apparatus as a whole. I believe that classical gymnastic exercises on the crossbeam and bars and also power and speed motions such as squats, presses, pulls, pulls, jerks and snatches will do for this. You need to spend a sufficient amount of time on setting the right technique, learn how to plan your diet of nutrients correctly and determine for yourself specific goals to which you will gradually approach. \n\nI understand that in my message there are not enough specifics, but I will not give concrete recommendations  for such a young organism about the volume of the load you need. The general advice is very simple, try to listen to your body, try different types of exercise, try to eat according to plan and rest fully. Try to find a circle of communication related to sports and have fun with training. Good luck!"

Try to expand your knowledge of different exercises, i didn’t know what a Romanian deadlift was, or what an incline skullcrusher was until i started asking around. It feels intimidating jumping in, but give it time and it’ll really start to latch on to you. There are some great fitness channels on YouTube (Untamed Strength is my favorite) but the bodybuilding.com channel has some great workout vids. Make sure to do plenty of practice on your main lifts (bench, squat ,deadlift, overhead press) before you move on to heavier weight and risk injuring yourself, read up on articles on reddit, watch some videos on YouTube, Hell even buy a book from like Mark Ripetoe or some other bodybuilders.

Think of exercises that target more than 1 muscle group, then focus on individual muscle after.  Example, day 1 squat, dead, split squat, good morning. Squat and dead’s train many muscles, then I hit each area more specific. Split squat train 1 leg, good morning back or hams depending on weight shift on feet. \n\nOr try push pull days. Day 1 upper body push, day 2 lower body push, day 3 UB pull, day 4 LB pull. Tats 4 days same areas.\n\nHope I gave u some ideas\n\n"

So by big muscle group and small wouldnt back/biceps work (back being the big muscle group) I could do deads and dumbell rows and lat pulldowns and maybe bicep barbell curls, preacher curls and concentrated curls. and so that's 3 excercises per muscle and I wanna work it out at least twice a week. So maybe I should go a bit light so I'm able to hit the same muscles again? Or should I do 3 muscle groups a day each muscle group 2 exercises where I go heavy and intense?\n\nMaybe a new split like this.\n\nMonday:back/biceps/shoulders\nTuesday: chest/triceps/legs\nWednesday:abs\nThursday:back/biceps/shoulders\nFriday: chest/triceps/legs\n\nI'm not too worried about abs right now as I want to gain muscle as I'm skinny and the core gets a workout from other compound excercises.

Bicep is a small muscle u dont need to work on it as often as the large ones.  so u can use that time for other muscles groups. that goes the same for the other muscle groups ur put in ur split. "

You must take a portion of slow carbohydrates for your breakfast such as oatmeal or buckwheat. The following 2 meals should contain high quality protein foods with vegetables. Excellent sources of protein for you will be poultry meat, cottage cheese and eggs. Better eat smaller but products with better quality.

What people typically think of when they want to “tone” they mean that they want to add shape without adding size. People wanting to tone also frequently don’t realize that to do this they need to both lose fat and build muscle. Two things that are very difficult to do at the same time. \n\nIf this aligns with your goals, it’s important to know that fat burning is not spot specific. This means that is doesn’t matter how many arm workouts you do, it won’t help you specifically lose fat in your arms but it will help you build muscle there. Fat is burned throughout the whole body. \n\nSo what you need to do is a two step process. You need to first build the muscle by doing hypertrophy workouts. This means high reps (10-20) with medium rest (45-90 seconds). It also means you should do a combination of compound and isolation movements. You need to be in a caloric surplus. The second step after you’ve built some muscle is to cut the fat and maintain the muscle. To do this keep the workouts the same but decrease your caloric intake to a 200-400 kcal deficit. Keep your protein high and your carbs relatively low. Hope this helps. "

  "text": "I would say then that the most optimal routine is one to best  develop general strength to combat things like muscle imbalances, posture, core strength, preventing lower back pain. If you have never lifted, the general principle is to make sure you focus on compound movements like the squat, deadlift, bench while throwing in some accessory work( pull ups, leg curls, etc, just to give some examples)  in order to hit your major muscle groups( legs, back, shoulder, chest) while developing a good foundation of general strength! The best ways to do this is full body three times a week to start. But you do not have to restrict yourself to this type of routine. Doing full body just gives you your bang for your buck because you get to basically hit your major muscle groups three times a week ( while working on form, being consistent at the gym). As with any workout routine, your diet, recovery and mental health will play huge roles. I am actually on a project right now on helping novice lifters get started! Lets stay in contact!"

You simply destroy your muscles and at best way they only have time to recover and adapt to such volume of training. \n\nThe second reason may be the predominance of red muscle fibers in your buttocks. In this case, you need to try high-repetition training. Perform 12-20 repetitions, until the sensation of a distinct burning sensation, and better even before the sensation of numbness in your muscles. I suggest that you do this type of training every 10-15 days, not more often.\n\nIn either case, you should alternate the load type to get the maximum result. I think that you need to build your training plan in such a way that contains heavy low reps, intensive mid reps and high reps workouts. \n\nI would also reduce the amount of cardio.

Then you need to find a good specialist to whom you can trust or the sports section in the direction that interests you. Be constantly interested in your own progress, ask questions, study new information. Only in this case you can hope for the result, but it will completely depend on your persistence, strength and time that you will spent. Of course, you can try to learn everything yourself, but the result will definitely be worse and you will spend considerably more time. Good luck!"

But in any case, a large number of repetitions can use more muscle fibers and this should affect the overall proportion of your lower body. Even a small increase in their volume can improve your forms. On the other hand, training in high repetition mode will help you better feel the work of a specific area and improve your individual technique. This will create the necessary potential for increasing working weights in training with a small number of repetitions. I think this should help you diversify your training and surprise your muscles with a new type of loading. Perhaps, this will improve the shape and proportions of your lower body."

 {
  "text": "For starters, you should focus on getting stronger and while doing so, maintaining joint integrity and flexibility. \n\nMy suggestions:\n\nFocus on the big lifts.\n- overhead press\n- bent over row\n- pullups \n- pushups\n- squats \n- deadlifts\n\nA solid routine example: \nWorkout A)\n- Goblet Squat (an easier, less risky squat variation)\n- Pullups (add weights once you can do 8-10 reps chest to bar, start with negatives)\n- Romanian Deadlift (another desdlift variation that’s less draining and able to be performed more frequently)\n- Overhead Press\n\nWorkout B)\n- Romanian Deadlift\n- Pushup (progress to ring pushups, one armed pushups, or pseudo planche pushups once you can knock 15-20 diamond pushups)\n- Goblet Squats\n- Bent Over Row \n\n\nPushups have a much lower likelihood of fucking up your shoulder, people often get shoulder injuries from bench press AND the bench inhibits the movement of your scapulae, which is vital to shoulder girdle health (you want that thing strong and mobile—it’s actual a bunch of things, but that’s for another time)\n\n\nSets, Reps, Frequency:\n- do three sets of 5-8 reps on each exercise. You can either pair each exercise (so rdl-pushup-rdl-pushup) or do straight sets (rdl-rdl-rdl). \n\nIf doing straight sets, rest 2-3 minutes between each set. If pairing exercises, rest about 1.5 minutes between exercise (pairing exercises will save time but will increase intensity). The rest time between each exercise works out to be the same amount, when pairing exercises you’re just doing double the work, shortening your time in the gym. \n\nDo this routine every other day with AT LEAST one day of rest between workouts. On these off days, go for a walk and do yoga (i like the Gaiam Yoga Studio app - it’s free), you could join a studio. But yoga or stretching is VITAL to counterbalance the joint compression of weightlifting. Neither are bad, just yin to the other’s yang (literally). \n\nDon’t do more than 3 weightlifting sessions per week. \n\nOne day a week, find a hill and run sprints for 10-15 minutes. Alternatively, jump rope for the same amount of time. The 10-15 minutes INCLUDES rest breaks. \n\nJoe Defranco’s “Simple Six” and “Limber 11” are great warmups for the weightlifting (once you get the movements memorized and can perform it without stopping it shouldn’t be more than 10-15 minutes)\n\nSo, in sum:\n\n3 weightlifting workouts per week. Warmup with the Joe Defranco Limber 11+Simple Six\n\n3 sets of 5-8 reps, increase the weight as you can perform 8 reps for three sets of each exercise (go up by NO MORE than 10 lbs in weight on each lift, per week)\n\nTake one day off, at least, between weightlifting sessions. Do yoga on your off days.\n\nRun sprints or jump rope one day a week for 10-15 minutes total (do the limber 11 as a warmup, for this as well). \n\nThat’s it. \n\nYou can add other stuff later, but simplicity and consistency are most important to a beginner.\n"

You want the seat to be high enough that when your knee is as extended as possible there is still a slight bend in the knee.\n\nCould also be that you’re doing too much pushing and not enough pulling. You should be simultaneously pushing down with one foot and you pulling up with the other. This distributes the resistance evenly between the quads and hamstrings. Too much quad work can hurt your knees. \n\nCould be over training. Cycling is less impact than walking/running however you are still doing a lot of work at the knee joint. Try doing some cross training with a different cardio option that works the knees less. Rowing and swimming are great options. "

  "text": "First...great job getting in the gym...you've already tackled the hard part was just getting started. As a fitness person myself I can share many tips to keep you going...and before you know it, making progress may become a personal addiction which happens to many. \n\nTip 1: You need to incorporate both a healthy diet and regular exercise routine. I recommend to everyone to download the free app \"MyFitnessPal\". It's a free app I use every day to track my caloric intake...you can even scan the barcode with the app for everything you buy/eat from the store. \n\nTip 2: On Google, search \"free TDEE calculator\"...we need to find how many calories your body needs to maintain your current weight and once you know that, you'll have actual goal to consume less than your daily need to maintain your current weight...this is what is know as a \"caloric deficit\"...adding regular exercise on top of a caloric deficit will melt body fat quickly!\n\nTip 3: Make a weekly fitness routine, but nothing too hard. For beginners I recommend 3 or 4 days a week. For example: Monday upper body, Tuesday lower body, Wednesday break, Thurs upper/Friday/lower. Also incorporate cardio into your week; if you can't jog/run yet, then go for half hour walks a few times a week. \n\nTip 4: Take a body selfie at least once a week...some people like to take one every day first day of the morning. As you start to see your body change it will help keep you motivated. Plus...down the road you'll have a reminder of your old life and use them to stay with your new lifestyle. But be patient, changes in your appearance happen slowly but if you do everything I'm advising, I promise you'll see results if you stick with it. \n\nTip 5: There is an overwhelming amount of free tips, workout routines, healthy recipes on youtube...a very useful and free resource. \n\nTip 6: When it comes to healthy eating, it all doesn't have to taste bad. You can use things like hot sauce, salsa, no calorie sweeteners, etc to improve taste. A very simple high protein thing I make/eat is browning 1lb 97% lean beef, drain.  MyFitnessPal says just 4oz of this beef is only 170 calories and 23g of protein. Scoop 4oz of the browned beef into a bowl and add 2 tblsps of medium salsa  (only another 20 calories) and boom...you have a good tasting, high protein meal low in calories. Focusing more on protein too will help you feel full and is best for growing and repairing muscles. \n\nThat's all I have time for now but those tips are more than enough to get you started. Keep us posted on your progress and stay strong buddy! "

  "text": "Crossfit is a good choice for you. The only issue is you need to swap out high reps with moderate weight for low reps with maximum weight or for calisthenics go for fewer reps but with slower movement. Add calories to your diet every week, try to add +100 calories til you're at around 3.25k cals /day. Eat lean. There's no reason you cant gain lean mass with crossfit, you don't have to dirty bulk and completely cut cardio, though with cardio it will be slower results as you're burning cals more so for organ function than muscle recovery. That's why I mentioned to eat so much, to try and offset that effect. Also after doing crossfit it doesnt hurt to try to get in a small regimen of lifts. Nothing big but just isolated areas. For example, if you want bigger arm, after crossfit, do some bicep curls or tricep extensions, etc. Muscles actually grow best this way anyway. If you do tricep extensions then follow it up with pushups you will see dramatically faster results than either alone."

  "text": "(Below is copied my comment from another post)\n\nYou'll need to look at this as a 3 piece puzzle.\n\n1.  Your diet needs to be put in check. Stop eating anything that comes from a bag, box, or can. Get a meal tracking app to track what you stuff into your face. You need extra protein to pack on muscle. You need to monitor your calorie intake. I suggest the MyFitnessPal app - it will set up calorie goals automatically based on your exercise level and lifestyle. Eat more leafy greens. Eat whole foods (meat, rice, vegetables, fruit)\n\n\n2.  Sleep better. You build muscle and burn fat in your sleep, not in a gym or running. Be sure to get 8-9 hours of sleep\n\n\n3.  Walk 20 minutes per day to help burn fat (running is not suggested if you want to build muscle). I'd suggest doing full body workouts.  Compound lifts (where multiple muscle groups are required - like Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift) Try the **Novice** version of Fierce 5 https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931\n\nBest of luck. Remember, this is not a race. The most results will occur over the first 12 months of this. Building sizable muscle will take years, but keep at it.  Hope that helps..."

Probably around a 2.5k calorie diet to put on weight. make sure the meals are composed of high in protein \\(chicken, steak, cheese\\) and carbs \\(usually early on in the day and slowly less as the day continues so that you don't have excess carbs that can turn into fat if not used\\). Monitor your weight and stay hydrated;\n\nNow for exercise, my workout for chest is part of my \"Chest and Tri's\" day. So i would start off will warming up with the bench with just the bar and working slowly up to your \"working weight\" \\(working weight you should be able to do 4 sets of 6\\-8 reps; if you cant reach that goal, LOWER THE WEIGHT\\) and after flat bench, incline bench with dumb bells or incline bench. do the same but lower the weight from flat bench because it is harder and probably a bit fatigued after flat bench. Do some machine chest workouts for decline if your gym has and move onto cable fly's. For cable fly's, it is hard to maintain form esp. if youre a beginner. If the form isn't on par, then do the machine flies for chest \\(4 sets of 10 take it slow and flex\\).\n\nAfter all the chest workouts, THEN I would tire out my triceps. I don't like doing triceps between chest workout because if your triceps are tired, it would be profoundly harder for you to continue with chest workouts. Tricep workouts would include rope triceps, straight or V bar triceps, skull crushers, push ups, close grip bench. try to stick with a high volume \\(higher amount of reps 10\\-12\\) to tone a build muscle. \n\nWhen you first start gyming, Consistency with diet and workouts is the key to gain muscle. PLEASE WATCH YOUR FORM, don't hurt yourself. by focusing on form when you first start gyming, you develop a good framework for the future and lower your risk of injury. one injury can affect you for a lifetime so becareful.

Just make sure that you are eating clean, mostly whole foods (that is no junk food or processed foods, packaged prepared foods) and try to reduce your consumption of fat. \n\nAs far as the chest muscle development, there are a lot of workouts that can effectively engage the chest. Try including resistance bands in your workouts. The bands place constant stimulation on the engaged muscle throughout the entire movement of the exercise. They create a sort of muscle stimulus that lifting with weights can't duplicate and can improve your gains and lifting ability in the gym. Look on YouTube for resistance band chest workouts. \n\n[**-BodyLaunch.com**](http://body-launch.com/welcome)"

Doing that when trying to lose weight is difficult.  Active muscle fibers burn calories more and faster even when you're sleeping.\n\nI would concentrate on cardio like daily jogging/running.

This helps you with obtaining information about working out, and you can start building from there. What you will be mostly be focusing on is calisthenics, and you can do some fairly challenging ones in the future. Right now, start easy and gently. You want to work the whole body out, but do it by parts instead as a whole; it reduces the amount of time spent recovering and or getting an early injury. Also, as you work out, be sure to change your diet as you go and find one suited for you. The same is for sleeping. I recommend you sleep for about 8+ hours and you can lower it as you go. The real muscle building happens when you sleep after all. \n\nAs for push-ups, do some knee push-ups instead. If you start at something harder, and you strain too much in doing so, you can injure yourself and do the opposite of what you want to do. \n\nThere is no reason to rush since we all start somewhere. :)"

Plus running all the time and nothing else puts wear and tear on your legs. I prefer to switch it up.\n\nI do different machines for 15-20 min of cardio - either treadmill or stair master every day I work out. Then rotate chest and shoulders, bi’s tri’s and back, and leg day - after cardio. After the weight routine you should do some core workout every day too.\n\nIn addition to that my gym offers yoga classes so I’ve been tacking on a night yoga class. Which I definitely sweat in, but I’m there to stay flexible and loose.\n\nThis is the ideal workout routine for me and I feel I’m covering all the bases and not getting bored."

Mountain biking has a greater fun factor so if you don’t have an addictive personality that may be easier to do. You can go to your local bike shop to test ride a bike and since it’s spring you can check on Facebook with the bike stores around you to see if they have any demos in the future, which is basically when the bike shop takes almost all of their bikes to the local trail and let anyone ride for possibly a small fee and your drivers license. You can go to r/MTB or    r/bicycling  to get advice on what bikes you should be looking at, but you’ll probably want a hard tail to do cross country trails. If you want to road bike I don’t have much advice because I don’t do that, but I’m sure there are road biking sub Reddit’s that can help you out. "

I’ve only done a dab once and I can’t imagine doing anything other than laying on the couch for the next few hours after. I also have a pretty big tolerance to preworkout since I’ve been taking it on and off for about 4 years. \n\nSo don’t discredit the weed and preworkout combo.

  "text": "Eat eat eat eat eat. Eating more (clean food) is the vast majority of putting on muscle, and no you do not need a base of fat to build muscle, they’re independent of each other. If you workout without eating more than you’re used to, you’ll just get a little more lean without putting on mass. Here are the steps commonly used to start a good bulk, and have personally helped me put on good weight: \n\n1. Set a goal weight after a set amount of time (I want to be 70kgs in 3 months)\n2. Look up macro intakes for that desired weight. Macros include tracking your calories, proteins, fats, and carbs. \n3. Research foods and meals that help hit your macros \n4. Eat those foods and hit your macros daily\n5. Don’t forget to stick with your workout plan too! Eating excess food without working out is where you gain bad weight. \n\nStick with a basic 5x5 strength building plan (there’s tons online). Focus on getting stronger, not bigger. Strength training is the first step of building, in addition to dieting. \n\nI will warn you though, hitting excess macros (force feeding) is harder than limiting your diet when you first start. \n\nResearch supplements online as well. Mass gainers are shakes that are packed with the macro essentials and help you hit your daily macro goals. "

Try “these habits are not healthy for you and I am concerned about your health. This isn’t the lifestyle I want for either of us and I think we need to hold each other responsible for our own wellbeing.” \n\nBut even that will make her defensive. She will either dump you on the spot or change her life lose weight and then dump you. But maybe this is for the best. Clearly physical appearance is very important to you and that’s fine. But it may not be a priority for her right now and it’s best if you go your seperate ways. \n\nYou could also try talking with her to find out if she is depressed, stressed, or has some other issue going on that is causing weight gain and try to help her through that. Remember, relationships are partnerships. As much as it is her job to stay healthy and take care of herself it is your job to support her through issues she may have. Maybe just start by going for walks in the evening, maybe get her interested in a hobby/sport that is more physical, maybe suggest therapy if her self esteem is low. Maybe go on a diet together. If you have done these things and have genuinely put in the time and effort to help her and she still does nothing, then you should ask why you want to be with such a person?\n\n"

  "text": "(Below is copied my comment from another post)\n\nYou'll need to look at this as a 3 piece puzzle.\n\n1.  Your diet needs to be put in check. You really are what you EAT and getting your body in shape doesn't start by stepping into a gym, it starts on your plate. Stop eating anything that comes from a bag, box, or can. Get a meal tracking app to track what you stuff into your face. You need extra protein to pack on muscle. You need to monitor your calorie intake. I suggest the MyFitnessPal app - it will set up calorie goals automatically based on your exercise level and lifestyle. Eat more leafy greens. Eat whole foods (meat, rice, vegetables, fruit)\n\n\n2.  Sleep better. You build muscle and burn fat in your sleep, not in a gym or running. Be sure to get 8-9 hours of sleep\n\n\n3.  Walk 20 minutes per day to help burn fat (running is not suggested if you want to build muscle). I'd suggest doing full body workouts.  Compound lifts (where multiple muscle groups are required - like Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift) Try the **Novice** version of Fierce 5 https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931\n\nBest of luck. Remember, this is not a race. The most results will occur over the first 12 months of this. Building sizable muscle will take years, but keep at it.  Hope that helps..."

Also after you finish try not to come to a dead stop dead stop keep going at a light easy pace for 10-15 and that should help with the weakness you feel afterwords with the extra benefit of moving some of the lactic acid that’s making you sore. \n\nHope this helps"

You think you can do a lot more than you really can and you pay for it the next day. My advice is to wait until the soreness goes away. If you’re still sore in 3 days go workout anyways. You need to gradually work your way up. Start with something easy. Even if you feel like it’s too easy it’s fine. You’re not working out to increase your cardiovascular endurance at this point. You’re in a transition phase. Your goal right now should be to get your body to adjust to the point where you can challenge your cardiovascular system without the muscles being super sore the next day. "

  "text": "For dieting, I’d personally recommend the Ketogenic diet, as it’s one of the easiest to follow and gives incredible results. I have lost over 60 pounds of fat in just over 6 months, with minimal exercise due to my demanding schedule. I use the “carb manager” app, and simply cut out as many carbs and sugar as possible, while eating healthy fats and moderate protein. If you look up r/keto, r/ketorecipes, or Thomas Delauer and/or KetoConnect on YouTube, they can help explain it a lot better than I can. \n\nBest of luck, but a quick side note: don’t compare yourself to others... High school is a minuscule blip on your life’s radar, and you won’t remember or stay in touch with 75% or more of those people after it’s over with... if you want to be healthier and lose weight, do it for YOU. You’re the one consistent person in your life who will be around years down the road, so the only person you should try to impress or compare yourself to... is yourself! :-)"

  "text": "Yes! Eating Keto is most definitely a lifestyle change. It trains your body to become “fat adapted” so that you utilize excess fat instead of glucose for energy. You can always introduce carbs again at any point, but you honestly won’t want to after a couple weeks into the change! Most people I speak to, or those supporting this way of eating online, talk about how detrimental carbs are to us, and how staving off them gives you so much more energy and clarity after your body makes the initial adjustment. \nA lot of people talk about the “Keto flu” they experience when first starting this way of eating, but it’s simply your body adapting to no longer using glucose (sugar) as energy, and burning fat to make ketone bodies that your brain utilizes far more cleanly/efficiently than glucose. It’s mainly just a feeling of lethargy and weakness, but it passes quickly (especially if you stay well hydrated). WELL worth it, in my opinion!"

I personally think I get a better workout when I’m at a gym because I have pressure from other people.\nI’d start with body weight stuff at first (I’m not a professional I’m just telling you what I did starting when I was a Junior in High School). How I scheduled it was a Mon-Fri plan, and took the weekends to recover/stretch/roll my muscles out.\nI think that’s a good place to start, by planning out what you want to do each day for how many days per week.\nWhat my 5 day plan usually looked like:\nMonday- light cardio, usually consisted of walk/jogging intervals for 45-50 minutes. \nTuesday- Leg Day. My favorite, a good place to start will just be doing squats, lunges (forward and backward), burpees, calf raises. By doing body weight at first, you’ll learn the movement correctly and start building stability muscles. There’s also quad, hamstring, adductor and abductor machines if you choose the gym route!\nWednesday- depending on how the first 2 days went I’d usually do core and stretching.\nThursday- “hard” cardio, more running and sprints, pushing 45 pound plates across a track, just anything that’s REALLY going to make your heart work.\nFriday- arm day, I hate arm day I was never good at it. Start with low weights and 8-10 reps for 3 sets on whatever muscle your targeting. Biceps, do bicep curls, tricep extensions (for triceps), military press (and lateral raises) for your shoulders.\n\nObviously that’s not all the muscle groups, so I’d interchange chest and back during the week. Also you’re by no means limited to those exercises, I just listed some basics. Google will be your best friend until you get the hang of coming up with your own workouts.\n\nGood luck!!"

As long as it's home cooked and you're not eating too much any diet is fine for the long term really. I saw someone recommending keto here and honestly it is pretty good, especially if you want to lose weight fast. However you will feel like you've got no energy sometimes and some moodiness mighy be expected. Generally what I do is fill half of a plat with protein and the rest with carbs and green vegetables.\n\nIn terms of exercise, lift weights if you want quick results. You'll make gains quite quickly if you're consistent and don't worry about getting bulky because you won't. The key however is consistency. Since you don't have a gym membership, calisthenics is also a good choice and I do it myself so I can guarantee that you won't need any equipment save for a pull up bar ( if you'd like ). It'll get you in shape, albeit a bit slower, and you'll have a balanced build as everything you do is usually compound exercises anyway.\n\nI'm 17 so I know how you feel but as long as you keep consistent with what you do, you can't go wrong.

If anything train your legs and lower back as exercises that target those groups help promote the excretion of growth hormones. exercises like deadlifts, squats etc. You have a lot of days that target your upper body. Try using multi join or compound movements for your upper body, you will have better results vs training arms twice a week. Your arms will always be used you dont need 2 days for them. instead of targetting specific muscle groups, you can try looking at push pulls days. That will give you a better variety of exercises that involve more movements in one exercise. "

I like a few beers on the weekend and a slice of cake or three.  It's taken a lot of getting used to, but I eat small healthy meals during the week, mostly salads and veggie meals with quorn, so I can enjoy the shit out of some nice calories on the weekend. Low fat hot drinks, coffee and green tea and lots of water get me through the peckish times during the week.  When I finally got my eating organised, I finally began to get control of my body fat.  For exercise I mainly do fast walking of a two miles, then a kind if 5×5 exercise routine (you tube is your best friend - look up beginners 5×5), like squats Deadlifts bench press, overhead press, and that one that looks like a dog having a piss,  etc.  Those exercises may seem like they are only for body builders, but with lighter hand weights they are a super quick workout and super effective.

You can also increase tension by choosing progressively difficult variations of a given exercise to make it more difficult as you go.

That means you burn more calories throughout the day than you do when you don’t workout, so you’re getting a lot more benefit than just the session. \nKeep up the hard work!

  "text": "60g is a lot to take in in one setting. Current nutritional science says your body can only digest about 32 grams in one setting. Meaning if you eat 60 two times, you’re just shitting about 60 grams out and your body is doing nothing with it. My suggestion is to eat meat and other real protein sources other than shakes. When you eat solid foods it puts a limit on the amount you can eat. This makes it a lot more likely that your body will actually be able to process the amount that you give it. Plus, since it takes longer to break down the food, it gives the body more time to absorb the protein. "

  "text": "Myth: Maintain a steady supply of amino acids by eating protein every 2-3 hours. The body can only absorb 30 grams of protein in one sitting.\n\nTruth\n\nWhenever you hear something really crazy you need to ask yourself if it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. It's a great way to quickly determine if something may be valid or if it's more likely a steaming pile of horseshit. This myth is a great example of the latter. Do you think we would be here today if our bodies could only make use of 30 grams of protein per meal?\n\nThe simple truth is that more protein just takes a longer time to digest and be utilized. For some concrete numbers, digestion of a standard meal is still incomplete after five hours. Amino acids are still being released into your bloodstream and absorbed into muscles. You are still \"anabolic.\" This is a fairly standard \"Average Joe\"-meal: 600 kcal, 75 g carbs, 37 g protein and 17 g fat. Best of all? This was after eating pizza, a refined food that should be quickly absorbed relatively speaking.\n\nThink about this for a second. How long do you think a big steak, with double the protein intake of the above example, and a big pile of veggies would last you? More than 10 hours, that's for sure. Meal composition plays an important role in absorption speed, especially when it comes to amino acids. Type of protein, fiber, carbohydrates and prior meals eaten all affect how long you'll have amino acids released and being taken up by tissues after meals.\n\nJust to really drive this home - the source of this myth is the fact that your body can only absorb about 25g of protein/hour. That's actually been pretty well tested and is true. This led some people who weren't thinking very clearly to conclude that you must only be able to absorb 25g of protein in a 'sitting' - a sitting's just about an hour right?\n"

He went from barely managing to finish 1 plate of rice and chicken, to eating 3 people's worth of food.

When we are having dinner with 5 people, he'll finish his food (double entree) and finish up everyone else's food that they left. He went from 160 lb to 240 lb in less than a year.

  "text": "I was a Marine, and I have stayed very active since.  I consider myself a balanced athlete and I will offer my advise after 15 years of working out, some personal training, competing, and being in sports.\n\nYou can definitely do one day, two at most.  Squats and deadlifts will be a great focus point.  Only Do one of those, or one heavy and one light, if you choose one leg day.  Lunges, leg press, romainian deadlifts, box jumps, and tire flips are all great leg exercises that help with athleticism.\n\nKeep in mind that when you first start encoporating a leg routine, you will be very sore.  Until your body gets used to this, your running will be difficult.  This will change in a short amount of time though.  You will become a much better athlete all around when this is a regular part of your routine.  Lifting helps to prevent injury when it comes to sports or running.  Doing mostly lower weight with higher reps will be good, but I suggest to change this occasionally to higher weight in the 8-10 rep range or even the 5 rep range to promote muscle strength and growth.\n\nI hope this is helpful.  I've ran many times ranging from 1-23 miles.  I consider myself an avid weight lifter as well as someone who wants to be functionally strong and athletic.  Hitting the weights has done nothing but improved my athletic performance all around.  Have a great day!"

  "text": "I would personally switch up and try to do a little more weights with cardio after since you are wanting pecs and abs as well. Paced running burns a lot of calories, even more than weight lifting during the exercise itself. However doing weights and creating a stress on those muscles with anarobeic exercises will help you burn more over time by raising your metabolic rate for a set period. If you want all this to take a bigger effect, and to see more results even sooner, you are going to have to diet. Count calories with the goal of just a small calorie deficit, maybe 200-300, and do some macro managing. Lower carbs and fat with higher protein. \n\nThis is what I personally found to be a decent combo to cut some weight and get a leaner look to boot. \n\nAs far as motivation, it can be a struggle for everyone. Sometimes it all feels worthless because you aren't getting those results you want. Even when you know it's all for a bigger future goal you feel it's a dead end and wasted time. I personally have no like minded friends when it comes to a healthy lifestyle and working out. So I have to find like minded people on social media to keep the mindset and motivation. It sounds silly but follow some workout people on Instagram  or Twitter and follow some posters on here. Watch some videos that may interest you about an exercise or diet when you're just sitting on the toliet and bored.

This is the easiest place to start.  Don't chase some fad diet, slowly change your lifestyle to be more active and healthy.  \"It's not about the intensity, it's about consistency.\""

  "text": "Okay....I won't be able to go in as much depth as I would like because I'm on mobile... But going low-carb at least during the first half of the day doesn't work long term for dieting. Our bodies Need/crave/feed off carbs...especially pre-workout.  It's the processed sugar and processed carbs you gotta watch out for.\n\nWhat I've done to help hundreds to shred weight and keep it off is the 300 calorie way of eating. Eat 300 calories, every 3 hours 5 times a day (for starters). For bread, I'd highly recommend Dave's Killer bread. Nuts N More makes some amazing tasting peanut butter spreads (or just make sure you're buying natural PB). PB2 powder is great for shakes too!  Get on a good protein. Protein isn't just for beefy dudes lifting, the aminos and broken down enzymes that are in good protein shakes now will help out a ton when eating healthy.\n\nTurkey, tuna, salmon, chicken, etc when it comes to meats. Also, don't confuse carbs with starches. For instance, when I say keep the majority of your carbs in the first half of your day that doesn't mean you can't have some healthy starches with your protein for dinner (sweet potatoes, squash, etc). Also, plan plan plan ahead. I'd recommend a modified version of No Bake Energy Balls if you Google it. If you're on the go or at work and need that 3 hour snack and don't have the time, make these balls excuse yourself to the bathroom and woof one down. They're amazing (just one a day tho). My recipe for that Is:\n2 cups old fashioned quick oats (or gfree if you don't eat gluten(\n2/3 cup raw unprocessed honey\n1 cup natural chunky peanut butter\n1/2 cup dark chocolate cut into small small pieces or blended\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract or 1tsp vanilla and 1tsp coconut extract if you're a coconut fan\n1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes toasted in oven\nCombine all in huge bowl, mix well and put in freezer for 10 min then take it at and roll into balls (getting it cold in freezer makes them easier to roll and they don't end up all over your hands :)\n\nAnyway, I have a lot more suggestions but I won't take up the thread.

Second, a good creatine/pre workout. I'd recommend Muscletechs Shatter Black Onyx or similar. Third, a BCAA to get your needed Leucines, Glutamines, Isoleucine and Valine. I like Xtend BCAA (Watermelon rocks). This will help with your muscle growth but more importantly recovery and electrolyte replenishment without all the sugars.  Also multivitamin hands down.

I take it with water and i just make sure to minimize my caffeine intake outside of this supplement (e.x. not drinking coffee). Although most of these results are just from water mass (from the creatine in the supplement) I can't complain at all. Of all the supplements I've used this one seems to have the perfect mix of everything that balances results and no other effects. Also it's not too expensive. "

  "text": "You can definitely gain muscle and lose weight at the same time, but it takes a shit ton of work. Basically, you have to eat at a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat), but you also have to eat enough to feed your muscles (your muscles won’t grow if they don’t receive enough protein, and not just any protein). This will be difficult when just starting out, but it is possible if you work at it. Read a bunch on some of the suggestions I make below.\n\nLearn and understand how much your body burns a day. Consider Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and your activity level. It’s impossible to know the exact amount you burn in a day, but you should be able to calculate an approximation using a smart scale or an online calculator. Got that number? Ok now to lose weight all you need to do is eat less than that. How much less is up to you. \n\nWhen eating less, don’t go too low. You still need to feed your muscles! And the rest of your body. You need vitamins and minerals, along with various proteins. Eat lots of vegetables, and when you’re not eating veggies, eat salmon or some other fish, eat chicken (maybe 2-3 times a week), and as much rice and beans as you can handle. Nuts, milk, and eggs are also good, but don’t overdo it. Do some research on what macros work best for your goal and your body type. \n\nIf you can, I would suggest being as active as possible. This is good for a number of reasons! Exercise/moving is good for your heart, your posture, and your muscles. Blood flow to your organs and muscles is important. The more active you are, the more you burn, and the more you can feed your muscles without gaining excess weight. \n\nConsider purchasing some BCAAs and Glutamine if you want to build muscle and burn fat. These can be expensive but definitely worth it. BCAAs help you perform, so take about 5-6g before your workout, preferably after you eat a good energy snack, like banana and peanut butter if your stomach can handle it. Then, take 5g of Glutamine whenever you are going a prolonged period without food, especially before bed. If you don’t know about these, I’d do some reading. A quick google search will get you all the info. Trust me when I say these are miracle supplements. \n\nFor a good muscle building weekly workout schedule, I would suggest weight training on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and then do cardio/conditioning on Tuesday and Thursday. Look up some workouts, choose the ones you think will benefit you in the way you want to grow. \n\nI think that’s it. Sorry, that’s a lot of text. If you made it through all of that, thanks for reading! And I hope this helps. "

  "text": "It really depends what your goal is, and how your body reacts to what you’re putting in it. \nSome people will take powders that increase their alertness, like caffein. Some people take powders that increase fat burning, like Garcinia Cambodia. And really, there’s a ton more. But I’m personally not a fan of these as they make me feel like crap after. \n\nIf these don’t work for you, I would recommend glutamine and BCAAs. Honestly, these, along with a well balanced, Mediterranean inspired diet, can increase your workout performance and decrease your fatigue during and after a workout.  I suggest getting around 5g of BCAAs, 5g of glutamine, and some whey protein. The Gold Standard is a decent all in one especially for the price.\n\nBut if you want the best (in my opinion), you will need to spend some money and buy your powders separate. This allows you to make your own mix, tailored to your body’s needs. A lot of big names in fitness have their own pre-workout performance powder lines, backed by science, and their personal preference ratios. If you know your body, just do it yourself lol. \nFor me VMINO for BCAAs is pretty good. Plant based, good quality, but expensive- and I’m not a big fan of their flavors, but I just power through it. Pretty much any glutamine brand should be fine. I use Now Sports L-Glutamine. Cheap and great ratings. Simple. \n\nHope this helps."

It is difficult but doable for people who are new to lifting, especially for ex athletes who already have some muscle memory.  \n\nTo do it you need to be doing a lot of lifting and you really need to be pushing yourself. It’s hard to convince your body to prioritize muscle building over adding fat when you’re in a caloric surplus. It’s even harder to do so when you’re in a caloric deficit. It needs to be under pretty high physical stress to prioritize burning fat and building muscle at the same time. Lift weights. Go hard. Be in a caloric deficit. Expect to only lose fat and build strength. Any muscle building you do in that process is an added bonus. "

  "text": "Okay... Wow so many things to take apart here.\n\nFirst off \"steroids\" and \"over the counter stuff\" are two completely different things.\n\nWhat I BELIEVE you're talking is a pre-workout like a creatine+200-300mg of caffeine that gives you that boost to go hardcore. Yes, those can be extremely effective IF you already have the motivation to push through (for instance as a personal trainer I'd never recommend a creatine/pre-workout mix to a morbidly obese individual who can't be that mobile in the gym yet. If THAT'S what you're talking about...sure I can give you some recommendations but I'd need to know more of your exact goals in the gym first to know What to recommend.\n\nSecond, when you mention the word Steroid that signifies illegal/potentially side effect enducing/ harmful susbtances (like HGH, Dianabol, etc). These can come with certain mood altering side effects and, off course, if you use them long enough, testy shrinkage as well as other effects. Don't worry about these. I personally have never done a round of steroids but I've had close friends that have...and when using a certain steroid very carefuly and only one round of 8-12 weeks, they had crazy gains and still kept about 85 percent of that muscle after getting off them. But, like I said, they did it for their own research purchases and we're also personal trainers/competitive builders so they knew what they were doing. But anyway, hope this helps. I would try a pre-workout/creatine combines with a good BCAA for maximum results (and of course Hydrolyzed whey protein). Gl to you."

 {
  "text": "Before you try steroids, I hope you read this.\n\nWhy do you even want to workout? Why doesn't everyone just buy steroids and get a perfect body?\n\nWorkout teaches discipline. To get a good body naturally means you controlled what you intake, found time and did hard work. If you aren't disciplined, how do you wish to maintain what you get?\n\nYou can get motivated in healthier ways. Quitting addictions, Wim Hof, organising your day and just overall finding time to relax.\n\nIf you are still not convinced, take steroids with all their temporary side effects. Post again when you loose the strength you cannot maintain."

  "text": "Hey girl! First let me just tell you I understand how it feels with the whole push up situation! I could barley do a single pushup when I first started.\n\nWhat I can recommend is working on strength training to gain more muscle mass, which then creates a more toned look.\n\nAnd with your upper body, don't worry if it's not as strong as you'd like. Start small by doing modified pushups and other variations to build up to a full pushup or for any exercise as of that.\n\nAlso, Blogilates youtube channel is great! I personally don't watch her videos anymore but I remember a lot of great workouts there.\n\nFor the eating before and after, eat some sort of carb with protein (for me that's a fruit/rice cake with peanut butter) before and eat some protein source after (I like greek yogurt with honey).\n\nAnd for workout recommendations, I'm assuming you are working out at home which is great! I like FitnessBlender strength workouts but if Blogilates has strength workouts (which I'm pretty sure she has) then do hers!\n\nGood luck on your fitness journey, you got this!"

  "text": "I also am starting to work out again. I really like finding workouts on Pinterest right now, and you can make a board to save the ones you like. \n-Also, for pushups you can keep your knees on the ground (when you're ready, keep your knees on the ground but bend your knees so your feet are close to your bum, it makes balancing harder).\n-You can also work on planks (which strengthen your whole body but especially your core, which will help with your shakiness). Try holding a plank for 10-20 seconds 3 times during each workout and build your way up from there.\n-Right now, I like practicing modified chatarungas (spelling), which help with your core and arms. You can find a video on YouTube that will show you what this looks like, but it's fairly straightforward once you see it.\n- Last thing, if you're working out at home don't be afraid to look silly and use household objects as weights! A bag of rice, heavy cans, or my favorite- a large water bottle filled completely, are all great objects. Resistance bands are also great. If you have a park or playground nearby, enjoy the nice weather when you can!\n\nIt can be tough to start, but don't give up, and don't beat yourself up if you're not where you want to be or you miss a workout. The most important thing is just trying your best, staying motivated, and being kind to yourself when things feel off. Good luck!"

So to answer your question, yes it will help burn fat, but its primary goal is to break muscle tissue and make the abs muscle stronger (if you do multiple rounds) if you really want your abs to show, focus on diet and fat burning exercises (cardio primarily)."

  "text": "When starting out I don't suggest going all out.  Ease in to it for 2-3 weeks.  This means higher reps and lower weights.  Whatever is comfortable for those 3 weeks.  Personally I would do a about 3 different exercises at 16 reps a piece.  Then do the 3 again at 15 reps.  Then once more at 14 reps.  This would take about half an hour.  As you feel and see the gains and this becomes easy, up the weight and stick at it for 45 minutes.  Eventually you'll love this and be sticking to the plan.  It takes a couple months so don't rush it and don't burn yourself out.  You'll find a rhythm that works for you.  As for food.  Carbs before a workout and protein after.  The carbs will give energy and the protein will help with muscle.  Last, don't be afraid to join a gym.  Not a single person in their is judging you.  We all started at the same weak ass point.  If you're unfamiliar with equipment, any gym I've joined is happy to give some free personal training advise.  A small gym may be best to start, I like these years after starting, since they bring in the less hype crowd who come to work out and leave. "

And I hate to direct you to another subreddit, BUT, if you don’t want to/ can’t join a gym, I’d check out r/bodyweightfitness their sidebar has tons of FAQ and a phenomenal recommended routine that pretty much helps you gauge where you are in your level of fitness.\n\nAs far as drinking water, yes, always yes, never too much water. And eat clean. What is “clean”? well, grill instead of fry, cook at home, don’t over indulge, watch your portions, and keep an app or diary of workouts and eating. \n\nAlso, (sorry for the wall of text), check out  r/yoga. I know it doesn’t seem like the “manliness” of ways to get fit, but I have fallen in love with both the mental and physical aspects of yoga. There’s nothing more fulfilling than being able to touch your toes, hold your body weight in a handstand, and be able to perform some pretty cool positions. \n\nFeel free to PM if you need/want more advice, I’ve done tons of research myself."

Whether you’re sick, sore, exhausted, frustrated, bad day at the job, or family issues, WHATEVER brings you down, don’t skip a day. Don’t do it. Set yourself a “rainy day” workout. So on those days say maybe you’ll do 25 push-ups, or 3 sets of X workout no matter the reps or weight. \n\nSkipping days creates a bad habit and a hurts your dedication and motivation.

The only way for the body to get rid of energy is through physical work and routine body functions for life sustainment. If you're taking in more energy than your body needs to reform its daily tasks then that energy is stored in the form of fat. The thing is most people think they're starving themselves when they diet when in reality their just eat at natural level. Diets arnt unnatural, the typical American diet is what is unnatural. When you can see that, losing weight becomes much easier. It's just hard because as Americans we've been raised on over eating so it's very hard for us to cut back to a more healthy limit of food. You'll suffer the first few weeks but you'll get used to it. Caloric intake reduction is the only way to lose weight accompanied with more physical exercise and lean muscle building if you want to speed up the process."

For example, 2 minutes running high pace—&gt;1.5 walking for twenty minutes. This can be done 3-6 times a week, depending on how your body reacts.\n\nThe endurance training will help with your LD running. To get to your goal of 2 Miles, you should first see how far you can run in general. Go for distance first, then speed.\n\nWeight training should include squats, calf raises, and leg presses to work your legs (this will help build muscle and improve cardio results). Core should be worked daily, google any proven ab workout, my favorite is the Army ab circuit workout, and stick to it. I’d stress working your obliques, if you strengthen them it could cut down on soreness. As arms and back go, triceps pulls and YTALS can build your back and chest.\n\nDieting should be your #1 - eat clean, and results will come!"

  "text": "(Below is copied my comment from another post)\n\nYou'll need to look at this as a 3 piece puzzle.\n\n1.  Your diet needs to be put in check. You really are what you EAT and getting your body in shape doesn't start by stepping into a gym, it starts on your plate. Stop eating anything that comes from a bag, box, or can. Get a meal tracking app to track what you stuff into your face. You need extra protein to pack on muscle. You need to monitor your calorie intake. I suggest the MyFitnessPal app - it will set up calorie goals automatically based on your exercise level and lifestyle. Eat more leafy greens. Eat whole foods (meat, rice, vegetables, fruit)\n\n\n2.  Sleep better. You build muscle and burn fat in your sleep, not in a gym or running. Be sure to get 8-9 hours of sleep each night\n\n\n3.  Walk 20 minutes per day to help burn fat (running is not suggested if you want to build muscle). I'd suggest doing full body workouts.  Compound lifts (where multiple muscle groups are required - like Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift) Try the **Novice** version of Fierce 5 https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931\n\nBest of luck. Remember, this is not a race. The most results will occur over the first 12 months of this. Building sizable muscle will take years, but keep at it.  Hope that helps..."

Almost everyone I know underrates it but especially as a beginner you can workout a sweat and start getting your body ready for athletic activities ( didn’t know any other way to phrase it lol). Start with just standing straight leg and try and touch your toes then I would spread out your feet and go down to the middle and then to each leg keeping in mind you want the opposite hand to touch the foot (I have been stretching for about two weeks and still haven’t accomplished this feat) and hold for about a 10 second count. Then sit on your butt and repeat. Finally I would say work by doing some fire hydrants ( hip stretch ).  If you can get a jump rope or fashion one out of some thing ( ie a real rope or whatever you see fit) and go 3-5 rounds for ab a minute to start and consider it a good beginner workout. Lastly diet I would say everyone knows burn less then you take in but stay away from refined sugar. And we all mess up but even if you can just prolonge the time for you to mess up and eat a sweet, it’s still a victory. Every meal counts and you should treat it like it does but don’t feel bad if you mess up there is always next time don’t let one bad meal through you off course.

I would take one before bed or at least an extra protein meal (ie a peanut butter sandwich or maybe a few eggs or anything like that). And if you really wanted to get into it you could get a mass gainer , they are like 100 grams of protein and 1100 kcalories. But anything high in protein will do.

However, I've big interest in health and a IB Course in Sports Exercise Health Science. \n\nFrom experience, and now later supported by science, often (often being said as every being is different) the most beneficial way of building muscle within an muscle group is regular workout, 3-4 times a week, 6x4 or 8x3 repetitions laying around 65&amp;#37;-80&amp; max. This along with a protein heavy diet and lots of rest! Its when resting that the muscle is being built! \n\nWith this said, building muscle is often not what people want when they say it is.

Cook them on the grill or oven 350 for about 15 to 20min depending size\n\nCarbs you can use brown rice or sweet potato. Dice the potato up little evoo and bake it for a little sweet homefries.\n\nVeggies I recommend fresh whenever you can. I love squash and red cabbage, brussel sprouts broccoli, asparagus all the things just mix them together and saute.\n \nSo good snacks can be: a banana, a protein shake with milk (keeps you full and milk has a casein protein that takes longer to digest. Almonds or some cashews (unsalted)\n\nAnd late night snack: cottage cheese with a little salt and pepper \n\nHope this helps"

But it's good that your muscles are sore and weaker! That means that it's working, they just need a bit more time to recover in between. Also make sure you're eating a high enough caloric intake, protein, yada yada yada\n\nHere's a quote from some [random article](https://www.livestrong.com/article/521047-reasons-to-not-work-the-same-muscles-every-day/) I found on Google: \"Ironically, training your muscles every day is one of the worst ways to build muscle. Muscles grow during the rest periods between sessions, says trainer and nutrition expert Damien Mase on the Muscle and Strength website. When you strength train, tiny tears form in the working muscles. It’s when you’re not working out that your body repairs this temporary damage by pumping extra blood into the affected muscles. This results in new tissue growth and therefore bigger muscles. If you don’t factor recovery time into your exercise routine, this process won’t take place and your muscles will not grow.\""

Like u/luckypepper said, you can't out-cardio a bad diet.\n\nAnyway! Back to your original question about cardio. I've been doing a running (2miles)/swimming(1hour)/biking(20minutes) rotation that I've been enjoying. I couldn't agree more that running is so incredibly boring- especially on a treadmill. I run at a pretty slow but decent pace and put a TV show on Hulu on and cover up the time/distance with a towel and only let myself peek after 5 commercial breaks. When I want to hate myself (I really hate cardio) even more after running or biking, sometimes I'll hop on the stair stepper or elliptical. Swimming is nice because after my hour of swimming I tan for an hour afterwards.\n\nIf your gym has those (cringe) group fitness classes, some of them are pretty fun. "

When building muscle and losing fat at the same time you may not see a lot of pounds lost, but that's only because you've replaced that fat weight with muscle weight. If possible I would recommend finding some way to measure you're body fat percentage as that will give you a more accurate measurement of how your workout is going. "

  "text": "What I do is a 3x8 of 4-5 exercises and I do a different body part each day. After that I play like an hour of basketball. What I’ve found is that if I challenge myself hard enough on the weights, it is kinda like doing light cardio because of what my heart rate is at. Also gaining muscle will help you lose weight over the long run. The more muscle you have increases your basal metabolic rate which means you basically burn more calories while sedentary. Losing fat is a long process and it will require a lot of work. Basically what most people recommend to lose fat is to calculate your basal metabolic rate(you can find a calculator for that online) and subtract 5% from that. That way you are at a calorie deficit and it will be the most healthy way to lose weight. I also use some supplements such as creatine and L-citruline for muscle endurance and increased nitric oxide. Some people use preworkout but I don’t use it because it has an unhealthy amount of caffeine and I don’t wanna blow out my heart lol. What I do before workouts is drink a protein shake with some creatine and L citruline. If you are starting from scratch then you should probably have some sort of workout program you should follow. Again, losing fat is not something you will see in a week or a month, so don’t get discouraged. It will probably take at least a year to get a drastic change. The program that I’m on is more for strength, not really for big muscles or anything, so you should look into a program that fits your needs. Although fat loss is your main goal, maybe have some secondary goals just so you are hyped to go back to the gym, such as getting your bench press numbers up. Another option that you should look into is calisthenics, where the exercises are mostly body weight. I haven’t done this but many people look pretty ripped off of that. But yeah initially starting out you should focus on going like 60% emphasizing proper form(for squats, bench press, overhead press, deadlift, etc) for a couple weeks and then you do something called progressive overload where each time you go to the gym you either add more weight or more reps. The problem that I have is I don’t eat enough sometimes so my progression kinda stalls but if your on the heavier side of the scale I feel like that won’t be too much of a problem for you and doing something like that will benefit you more. If you want I can send you what I do when I go to the gym just as like a template. "

  "text": "Doing High Intensity Interval Training on the treadmill would be a great start. It's Hell, but quick and effective, and has you feeling very productive. \n\nWhat it does, is shocks your body and boosts your metabolism for a longer period of time than any other workout I know if. It gets it pretty high/maxed out for anywhere between 12 and 72 hours, which means the calories you're burning at rest is more for that period of time. It also burns the least muscle mass than any cardio, as cardio does that. It's a good start to burning the fat covering your muscles.\n\nWhat you do is warm up on the treadmill. Then, you go at a pace that gets you a little worked up but not too much. For someone completely out of shape like I was, that was 3.5. After 45 seconds to 1 minute, you push yourself to a pace that you can barely do without collapsing. For me, it was 5.5 - 6.0. Do the for another 45 seconds to 1 minute. Then go back to the slower one for the same amount of time, then faster, then slower, etc. You either set your goal time or don't stop until you've pushed yourself past when you wanted to give up a couple of rounds. Don't forget to cool down.\n\nTrust, it will be difficult and epic, and you'll leave feeling like you did something useful to your body. You can add in weight training later, but don't have to at first. When you're ready to, though, simply search workout routines targeting specific parts of the body on YouTube and see how they're done before you try them."

  "text": "To add to u/mijoko24 weight training is a GREAT way to lose fat and tone up. \n\nOne thing to consider that you may not be for weight loss is that it is 70% diet. Cardio will definitely help you lose calories in the immediate, but over time having more muscle will make your TDEE for each day grow. \n\nSo don’t just throw out weight training as a bad idea since you want to lose weight. Another thing to go along with that, is since you are trying to lose weight, you should be eating less calories than your avg TDEE for each day and earning muscle gains will be harder than if you were to be bulking anyway. \n\nYou won’t turn into hulking from lifting weights, so don’t worry. Just eat under your daily TDEE, and do cardio and weightlifting.\n\nThen before you know it weight loss and toning up will be coming to you like a dream. "

  "text": "Start with a lot of body weight exercises. Go for holding the contraction for time, and don’t focus on adding extra weight. As you become proportionally stronger you could switch to exercises that add weight. \nIf you feel like that is bullshit advice (which it’s not) and you really want to “lift weights” from the start, then start with a lighter weight to begin and focus on eccentric contractions for the major muscle groups (e.g. squats that have a 5 second lowering down and then a 1-2 second powerful return to standing, or bench press that is slow to lower the bar to the chest and powerful to return to neutral.)\n\nStudies have shown that eccentric exercises actually produce more muscle hypertrophy than concentric exercises alone. \n\nThe 6 major muscle groups are back, chest, shoulders, arms, legs, and calves. I didn’t include abdominals because you should engage your abs throughout all of your exercises, regardless of the muscle group. And abs are easy to add in at the end of any workout. Make sure to train each muscle group at least once a week, whether that means you are doing a lot of full body exercises (squat to bicep curl to shoulder press combination for example) or you isolate each group and do several exercises targeting the ones you would like. \n\nEach person has their own workout recipe. Some people have a super furnace of an oven, while other people have to duct tape the door and finagle with the knobs to get theirs to work well. Everyone is different. And it takes a long time of consistent work to see noticeable results. I say this so that you don’t get discouraged and try to overshoot your capabilities early on. \n\nBackground: I have my bachelors in kinesiology. "

They're quick, easy, and can be a whole meal if you eat enough lol. But as far as workouts go, low impact cardio and bodyweight workouts are good for doing at home. Find between 6-9 different exercises you would like to do(Pinterest is where I find mine) then take anywhere from 30min to 1hr to complete 2-3 rounds of each exercise. Stretching is also very important! It keeps your muscles nice and lean and also helps protect you from injuries. Also taking probiotics or certain vitamins will help your body run smoother and process things better. Of course this is all from my own experience and are my own opinions, but I hope this was helpful for you. I wish you good luck in your weight loss journey.

First of all, start very slowly. Look to what your body tell you every day. Remove bad food. Sleep a lot. Drink a lot of water, green tea, hibiscus tea, caffeine, vitamins... Fasting 2 or 3 time a week can help a lot when you know how to do it in the right way.\n\nSome people go to a specific diet plan. I think it's ok, but I didn't. I put the carbs 90% in my post workout. I ate a lot of protein and good fat. But not like a Keto diet or a true low carb with no carb.\n\nIf you are really serius remove sugar, fried food and industrial ones.\nLook for the food with low calories density.\n\nAbout cardio, I didn't anything. I have some problems in my legs . I did only heavy workout to not lose the lean mass."

Lifting will get you there, but cardio can help. \n\nPersonally, it started with a TDEE calculator to figure out my mbr and then I cut 300 calories from that.  Everyone’s different but I’m currently on a 35/35/30 percent  breakdown of macros (protein/fat/carbs).  \n\nI’ve done higher protein and lower on the other two and just wasn’t getting results. Everyone is different though.  Also ate a lot of “whole” foods. Cut the processed stuff and opted for more nutrient dense options. \n\nTiming is key as well. If it’s a rest day I don’t worry about getting all the carbs in but maintain protein and fat.  Also last meals/snacks at night are high protein and fat as you don’t need carbs to sleep.  Last but not least post workout meals are carb and protein heavy.  Little to no fat. \n\nWorkout program is up to you but I started by doing a reset with a 5x5 of compound lifts with abs with very little isolation exercises for the first month.  After the first four weeks I’ve started doing more isolation, increasing the number of days reps and sets every 3 weeks.   Average time in gym excluding cardio is about an hour to an hour and 15 depending on warmup. \n\nCardio to save time would be about 20 minutes. 8 minutes of hiit and the remaining 12 minutes a steady pace run/jog/elliptical/walk at incline/row. \n\nBest of luck to you!"

The app will ask your goals and set your calories and macros accordingly and you can sync any fitness trackers you use with it as well. With regards to what to eat you can do it as a clean bulk (clean foods, little fat) or a dirty bulk (basically anything and everything). If you are finding it difficult to eat enough (and it is difficult some days 😂) just eat whatever you need to to hit your macros and calorie goals. This isn't ideal granted but if your main aim is putting on weight it's a means to an end. That being said try to stay clean as much as you can! \n\nTL;DR - morning workouts are tough at first but after a while nothing beats them, and make sure you eat enough.

Take the weight you want to use and cut it in half, be extra careful anytime your arms are above your head. You can see change fast with crossfit and it can be nice to just show up and not think about what you’re doing. \n\nA regular gym is going to be much less expensive, you can go whenever you want. If you have a plan already or you want to work on a single issue like getting bigger/smaller or work on physique only and you can self motivate pretty well or you have workout buddies then your local gym can be a great choice.\n\nEverywhere should give you at least a free day so try all of them out and if you like the crossfit workouts then try out all of the crossfit gyms in your area to make sure you find one with the vibe you like.

Remember that everyone's body is different though, and results can vary among each individual when it comes to routines and such.\n\nSo when I was fat I ran a lot, which let me lose enough weight eventually to where I could really focus on my muscles. When I do my biceps, I only do my biceps and nothing else. If I do decide to work more than one muscle in my workout, it's only one other muscle. So like I would have a bicep/back day or something along those lines. Still though, I have mainly only focused on working one muscle at a time. My workouts focus on the form and not weight, so I usually use 20 lb dumbbells with little to no breaks. I have a variety of moves with my dumbbells and bench and I workout for 30-35 minutes. When I work on only one muscle for my workouts, I get way more sore and I get better results."

That is, if we don't exercise as well.\n\n\nStop worrying. Celebrity Cruises, for example, has added six different types of exercises, in conjunction with the tony Canyon Ranch, to assuage the guilt-ridden while enjoying themselves at sea.\n\n\nThey include a cycling program where you pedal while looking out to sea, and a \"longevity\" routine that rolls back the hands of time, if not the wrinkles. And all the while, you are surrounded by a vista of sky and sea, without a drop of water touching you behind the glass-enclosed workout area.\n\n\nBut for those on land, those of us who may be spending some time in a hotel room after walking in a great city, or exploring wildlife, there are many ways to work out while on the road.\n\n\nIn fact, some hotel chains even have workout gear available if you forgot to pack some--such as sneakers and pants and tops.\n\n\nI'm not interested in muscle-building while on vacation--but I do want to stay in shape, and facilitate walking and swimming and even standing around in museums.\n\n\nMeka Lowe Teaching Abdominal Crunch\n\n\nI felt oh, so much better, after talking with a certified (and insured) trainer of 18 years experience--Meka Lowe. She has an extensive client list in New York, a high percentage of whom are people 50 and over. I even felt less guilty when she told me that folks can go up to two weeks without exercising before losing muscle tone.\n\n\nBut that doesn't mean you shouldn't exercise while away. In fact, you should.\n\n\n\"I call it an 'umbrella of fitness,' explains Mika (mekalowe@gmail.com). \"It's flexibility, balance, and strength, and you can do them even in your hotel room, even without equipment.\"\n\n\nFor example, you can use a simple chair to do what is known as a \"seated squat\"--standing and sitting, then standing and sitting again. This simple routine helps stability as it works the thigh, butt and hips.\n\n\nYou Can Do Chair Plank Anywhere\n\n\nA second exercise is called the \"chair plank\"--for 30 seconds you place your elbows on a chair seat while your legs are stretched on the floor, as pictured above.\n\n\n\"When you return from a vacation, you change the routine a little bit,\" she adds. \"When you go back to your old exercises, you can stay at the same weights--but you do fewer repetitions to start. Say, you were doing a lifting routine 10 times. Cut it back to five. Then gradually resume your old resistance.\"\n\n\nYou will be getting great exercise by swimming if you're taking a beach vacation or on a cruise ship. And if you're at the beach, an overlooked exercise is simply walking on sand. It is more efficient in burning calories and in making your body work than walking over concrete.\n\n\n\"If you do your 20 minutes of exercise on alternate days,\" she promises, \"you'll be able to retain your balance and other key elements of your body. I've yet to have a client gain weight on vacation. Enjoy wine and pasta.\" And exercise.\n\n\n \n\n✌ cool people read before commenting ✌"

Drink good quantity of water all long the day.\nSome green tea (not close to the workout).\n\nAbout chest workout. Do what every one do. Bench press. Push up. Change the speed of sets, the weight... Feel the muscle working.\n\nNot only chest, but every muscle you have to contract the maximum that you can. Make the muscle get tension and don't lose it with the relax points.\n\nReally force the muscle.

I originally assumed that I'd be lifting forabout  an hour or so for my full routine, but now it takes about 2 hours to completely get through. As far as what routines you should do, it's really up to you as far as where you want to start. When I began a year and a half ago, I started with my core, arms and chest since those were the ones I wanted to work on the most. Likewise, the workouts for whatever muscle groups you want to work can be found in youtube videos or online. The workouts I use to this day come from a workout routine app that I still sometimes use. Another good way of working out is using calisthenics, especially if you want to work your core. You'll definitely need a day or two with the machines and free weights to understand how they work and how to use them (depending on what you want to work). Also, one thing that kept motivating me was taking pictures of my progress every month to see the results. They may not be as good as you want them at first, but overtime it'll definitely come to fruition."

  "text": "(Below is copied my comment from another post)\n\nYou'll need to look at this as a 3 piece puzzle.\n\n1. Your diet needs to be put in check. You really are what you EAT and getting your body in shape doesn't start by stepping into a gym, it starts on your plate. Stop eating anything that comes from a bag, box, or can. Get a meal tracking app to track what you stuff into your face. You need extra protein to pack on muscle. You need to monitor your calorie intake. I suggest the MyFitnessPal app - it will set up calorie goals automatically based on your exercise level and lifestyle. Eat more leafy greens. Eat whole foods (meat, rice, vegetables, fruit)\n2. Sleep better. You build muscle and burn fat in your sleep, not in a gym or running. Be sure to get 8-9 hours of sleep each night\n3. Walk 20 minutes per day to help burn fat (running is not suggested if you want to build muscle). I'd suggest doing full body workouts. Compound lifts (where multiple muscle groups are required - like Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift) Try the **Novice** version of Fierce 5 [https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931)\n\nBest of luck. Remember, this is not a race. The most results will occur over the first 12 months of this. Building sizable muscle will take years, but keep at it. Hope that helps..."

  "text": "In my personal experience, along with friends and other guys at the gym, your first 6 months of lifting it really doesn't matter what you do you'll build muscle (newbie gains). Then that will usually start to taper off pretty rapidly after that. In that time just get familiar with the gym and the equipment and machines, also you can work on form, make sure you're doing workouts correctly. Look up YouTube videos, theres plenty of guides and do's and don'ts. (My favorites: Buff Dudes and Omarsuf). There too you can find detailed workouts. Also make sure you add more weight and are getting stronger all the time.\n\nPersonally I don't like cardio (who really does) and never really do it, I just watch my diet a little closer, but if you really want to do it, save your energy for the weights and do it after lifting. \n\nStretching is also a great idea, you don't really want to turn into the big buff dude that has to turn his whole body to look around. That too save until after your workout.\n\nOut of all of that the most important thing you can do is diet. Best way to go about it is to use the K.I.S.S. method (keep it simple stupid). Get a calorie tracker (i.e. myfitnesspal) and the best way to go about it is to track just calories and protein intake, dont worry about your fats and carbs. The golden rule is usually 1 gram of protein per body weight, if you're a bigger guy cut that by like 10 or 15 percent. Don't worry about it too much in the beginning, just get used to tracking calories and noticing what has protein and what doesn't.\n\nBuilding muscle is way easier than it seems. Hit the gym, eat your protein and be patient. It really does take time, just focus on getting stronger, and trust the process. Best of luck to you."

  "text": "Congrats on the loss so far, guys! You’re absolutely right, every single pound counts and the two of you are off to a great start. I can relate to what you said about experiencing something negative in your personal life and having your first instinct be to go to food as a coping mechanism, I grew up doing that myself and it took a lot of time and effort to break that cycle. The key is to be aware that you’re doing it though, as that’s crucial to breaking out of it and replacing it with a healthier outlet, such as exercise. These days my go-to stress reliever and anxiety-reducer is running, and I find I love it so much more than the snacks I used to binge on before I started working out.\n\nKeep up the hard work and good luck on your progress! And seeing as you both sweat about as much as I do, make sure to keep hydrated throughout the day! Cheers"

Regarding cardio, given the body fat percentage it's pretty safe to say that OP doesn't have much to work with, so some walking or light jogging is enough to get his cardio up.

  "text": " (Below is copied my comment from another post)\n\nYou'll need to look at this as a 3 piece puzzle.\n\n1. Your diet needs to be put in check. You really are what you EAT and getting your body in shape doesn't start by stepping into a gym, it starts on your plate. Stop eating anything that comes from a bag, box, or can. Get a meal tracking app to track what you stuff into your face. You need extra protein to pack on muscle. You need to monitor your calorie intake. I suggest the MyFitnessPal app - it will set up calorie goals automatically based on your exercise level and lifestyle. Eat more leafy greens. Eat whole foods (meat, rice, vegetables, fruit)\n2. Sleep better. You build muscle and burn fat in your sleep, not in a gym or running. Be sure to get 8-9 hours of sleep each night\n3. Your routine.  Walk 20 minutes per day to help burn fat (running is not suggested if you want to build muscle). I'd suggest doing full body workouts. Compound lifts (where multiple muscle groups are required - like Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift) Try the **Novice** version of Fierce 5 [https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931)\n\nBest of luck. Remember, this is not a race. The most results will occur over the first 12 months of this. Building sizable muscle will take years, but keep at it. As far as supplements, the only one I suggest is Creatine... Hope that helps..."

Sometimes weakness in a joint prevents you from being able to do a certain exercise more than weakness in a muscle group. \n\nSo to me it sounds like you need to start slower. Muscle pain during exercise is okay because your body can recover quickly. But joint pain takes much longer to recover from and can leave much more serious injuries.

Second, I invested in good running shoes based on my gait and shoe wear pattern (i pronate but not excessively).\n\nThe difference has been night and day.  Where I used to have to ice down my knees and pop Aleve like candy after EVERY run, i rarely do now.\n\nMaybe not be directly relevant to your elliptical workouts, but maybe the treadmill work is affecting you more than you realize.\n\nSo, young Reddit friend if any of this sound painfully familiar, maybe go to a running shop that does free gait analysis...a good shop will work wih you and make appropriate recommendations on footwear that fits your budget.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

For one it will create less imbalances that will lead to less chronic injuries as you get older.

That is a must do.\n\n2- Sleep more than 7 hours and half every day.\n\n3- Never break a fast with carbs. Only Proteins + Fat. (ever)When your body is in fast, it's crazy for nutrients. So it's best time to give it what your goals need.\n\n4- Look about the micros.\n\n5- Try change the ratio of your macros. Raise Protein and good Fat. Pay attention if work better.\n\n6- Try some routine experiments. If you don't try anything different your results will be all the same.\n\n7- Take sun or vitamin D3 every day.\n\n8- Change your cardio. Aren't you doing too much cardio? Or not doing any?\n\n9- Change your workout program. Look to different exercises for each muscle.\n\n10- Eat Fish or take Omega 3 all days.\n\n11- Look about food allergies and/or food intolerance.\n\n12- Go to a doctor to look about your hormones.\n\n13- Don't stop. If you stop what you started you wont get better results. Trust me, hahaha\n\n14- You are very young. Trust yourself with patient. Be confident.\n\n15- Add some metabolic food/drink. Like Green/Hibiscus tea, peppers, coffee, cinnamon, cocoa powder, avocado...\n\n16- Look about what your body are telling you.\n\n17- Change the way you workout. Are doing too fast? Too slowly? Are you losing muscle tension when exercising? Do you workout with focus? Are you doing full range of motion?\n\n18- How much do you cheat your nutrition?\n\n19- Cut, if possible, any caloric drink. Fruit juice, milk, soda...Also, eat less diary if possible.\n\n20- Change fake/junk food for real food always.\n\n21- Don't drink anything when you are eating.\n\n22- You are tall. That means you have to eat more to see the results. If you can't do big meals, do more meals per day. And some times do little fasting to improve your insulin sensitivity.\n\n23- Eat more dense foods. Like nuts. They have good fats, high caloric and help with male hormones.\n\n24- Avoid drugs (including alcohol)\n\n25- Do high intensity workout. Rest less between the sets and exercises.\n\n26- Don't pass more than 1 hour and 20 minutes working out.\n\n27- Some people says to avoid oxidants close to the training. Like Vitamins C, E, Omega 3 and Selenium. I guess is good to try.\n\n== EDITED =="

Believe in yourself.\nTry some experiments changing your nutrition and workouts.\nMaybe your job are disturbing your goals. Sweating hard for many hours is enough to kill a lot of bulking.\n\nAlso 45 minutes of cardio can be a little much for a hard gainer who are looking for more lean mass.\n\nStay motivated. Don't lose your goals.\nOther thing I remember: Coconut oil is very nice to help with high caloric diet staying healthy. Saturated fats help a lot with male hormones.\n\nHope you keep your journey.

My suggestion is to start by adding a mass gainer (one before you go to bed and one with breakfast if you want to have 2). On top of the mass gainer you also should add a 4th and possibly 5th meal. \n\nTrust me, as a kid who used to be 130-135 throughout all of high school who “couldn’t gain weight” even though “I eat large amounts of food”. You think you’re eating a lot because you’re full at the end of some of your meals. But if you aren’t gaining weight, then you aren’t eating enough. It’s that simple. Add more snacks in between meals and you need to eat a large amount each meal. If you’re ever hungry throughout the day, you’re behind in meals.

I was however over weight and approaching my 35th birthday). At age 41 I’m now stronger and healthier than I was in my twenties.\n\nSo as someone who has walked the walk, here’s my advice.\n\n1). Start slow. Add cardio conditioning 30 minutes x 3 days per week . Personally I really enjoyed kickboxing DVD’s (Jillian’s kickboxing fast fix is a good beginner , MOSSA fight and core de force are favorites), but light jogging with walking in between bits of jogging is good too: cardio will help condition you... it lays down the foundation for any other exercises or fitness you want to pursue.\n\n\n2). Once that feels good, I added some strength training. I started with a twice per week 40 min total body circuit. As I got stronger I added more strength work. But start here. I liked the MOSSA Power or Les Mills Pump DVD’s for this \n\n3.) Diet. I was really over weight. So I started forcing myself to count calories (it was an eye opener!). I also got a fit bit. It tracks activity level at work and gives you an idea of how many calories you need. I do warehouse work but lifting boxes didn’t compete w my love of pizza lol\n\n4. Smoking. I don’t want to preach, but quit. Best thing I ever did. I was really sad when I quit because I felt like I couldn’t take the breaks or go outside.... I gave myself ice water breaks instead. Every time I wanted to smoke, id make a cup of ice water and go sip it outside. \n\nAnyway , find things you like. I ended up enjoying home workout DVD’s , but try different things. \n\nThese days I lift weights following some DVD’s (body beast DVD’s specifically... love them!) and jog on my treadmill with audible books.... and couldn’t be happier "

You can get serious damage from it.\n\nYour concern that it will get worse and you will have surgery is something you will not be able to avoid.\n\nDon't work out, and go get a surgery!\n\n📷\n\nWithout a normal blood supply, the trapped tissues may **die**. A strangulated **hernia** is not very common and **will** cause severe pain, nausea, vomiting and even death. A strangulated **hernia** requires immediate surgical attention at the nearest hospital."

  "text": "It all depends on what your goals are.  If you’re trying to bulk up (get bigger/stronger) or trying to maintain just in better tone/shape. \n\nEither way there are 3 keys. Sleep diet and exercise. Can’t have success in both without the others. Start slow some light cardio and some range of motion exercises until you feel better and then start working into weights along with your cardio. Monitor your diet, and do your best to get a solid 8 hours. All 3 will produce results. 2 of three will have results but not maximized and result in increased chances of injury at the gym, and or low energy. \n\nYou’re taking the first step. Kudos!  Get it!"

It’s a good video but you will want a light weight for some moves:\n\nFor equipment -free options: There is also a 15 min core kinetics video on “core de force DVD’s” that is killer.

For yourself, for your happiness, your health or anything else you need in your life.\n\nOK? Your weight is not the problem. No one is better than other because of weight or body. But if you think you need to change, do it and never get back.\n\nLet me share about what I did, and still I'm doing right now. I'm from Brazil. I'm developer who studied a lot, I've the best degrees in my work area.\n\nExactly one year ago I had a chance to get an amazing Job in Australia. I was euphoric with the opportunity. But I lost the job vacancy, with no reason at all!\n\nThe interviewer disappeared before the interview! Yes, they even gave me the chance to try.\n\nOne entire week without sleeping! Gastritis. And then I get a heavy cold.\n\nIn day August 19th I wake up 4am. It was a Saturday, and I was 105ºF fever. I was fatty, depressed, sad and sick. I got tired of being sick all the time.\n\nI went to a mirror crying. Looked to myself and said: \"You are better than this. I deserve something better. Today I will change this poor life. I know you, I  will care about you like I do to anyone else who I love\".\n\nSo, next Sunday it will be one year of all this. One year of a new entire life.\n\nI can say for sure, I sleep better, I live better, I think better... My life is not perfect but as far I go more happy and easy is my life! All the difficult was only on the begging, like to jump in a swimming pool and be afraid to be cold. Don't think to much in the bad things, just do it. \n\nThat was me in September 2017 (in red):  \n[https://imgur.com/Iump9bf](https://imgur.com/Iump9bf)\n\nAnd that ones if from the beginning of this year:\n\n[https://imgur.com/BMErFW9](https://imgur.com/BMErFW9)\n\n[https://imgur.com/f76KYzI](https://imgur.com/f76KYzI)\n\nI'm still working on it and for me I'm a lot better than this pictures.\n\nIf I could, I have absolute no doubt you can do it too!

  "text": "Not a personal trainer, but I have a decent amount of knowledge on this kinda stuff. I would say ideally, you wouldn’t go into a workout being full or on an empty stomach. You don’t necessarily need to have a preworkout meal, but if you do I would recommend a small, slightly more carb heavy meal about 45 minutes before to fuel your workout. In terms of postworkout meals, I would always try and have a protein heavy meal (with some carbs as well) within an hour or so of working out, to achieve optimal recovery and muscle growth. The amount you eat and how hard you train will all depend on your diet of course. In your case of wanting to cut down, you want to keep your training intensity and volume on the Lower end, to preserve as much muscle mass as possible while you’re dropping those pounds of fat. Either way, you shouldn’t need to sweat TOO much about when you’re eating. Don’t be too hard on yourself if you have one bad meal or miss your post workout eating window every now and again. As long as you’re eating clean and focusing on your nutrition, you should be golden.\n\nGood luck friend! "

So eating or drinking something is nice to break it.\n\nAgain, it don't need to be a \"super fast\" carb or protein. But for me I avoid the very slowly food at this time too.\n\nIn other moments I go to what I need and didn't eat before.\n\nI guess BCAA normally help with glycogen and is fast digest.

Your goal after the first two weeks shouldn’t be to make any significant amount of progress. It should just be making sure you’re still showing up on a regular basis. Whether it’s cardio or weights.

  "text": "He's partially right - there is some time-sensitive information and clarification you should consider.\n\nWhat I believe he's actually referring to is protein synthesis.  This is where when you lift heavy, you break down your muscles (you create micro tears in the fibers).  This leads to DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) which is the soreness you feel after a workout.  Eating protein does help in repairing your muscles but only for a limited amount of time.  It's generally accepted that this process doesn't last longer than 48 hours (for natural lifters).  So what does this mean?  Here are a few tips:\n\n1. Soreness shouldn't be used as a guage - whether you feel sore afterwards or not has no bearing on this process - you body will synthesize protein whether you're sore or not.\n2. You should hit each muscle group (chest, legs, back, shoulders, arms) at least 2 times per week.\n3. Steroids increase the protein synthesis window but also speeds up the synthesis process allowing for more protein to become muscle.\n4. Don't focus solely on eating protein, be sure to eat carbs for energy and fats for your nervous system.\n\nThis is  very general, but I hope you get the idea.  Be sure to get good rest too since you don't build muscle in the gym - you build it in your sleep after a good work out."

  "text": " (Below is copied from my comment from another post)\n\nYou'll need to look at this as a 3 piece puzzle.\n\n1. Your diet needs to be put in check. You really are what you EAT and getting your body in shape doesn't start by stepping into a gym, it starts on your plate. Stop eating anything that comes from a bag, box, or can. Get a meal tracking app to track what you stuff into your face. You need extra protein to pack on muscle. You need to monitor your calorie intake. I suggest the MyFitnessPal app - it will set up calorie goals automatically based on your exercise level and lifestyle. Eat more leafy greens. Eat whole foods (meat, rice, vegetables, fruit)\n2. Sleep better. You build muscle and burn fat in your sleep, not in a gym or running. Be sure to get 8-9 hours of sleep each night\n3. Your routine. Walk 20 minutes per day to help burn fat (running is not suggested if you want to build muscle). I'd suggest doing full body workouts. Compound lifts (where multiple muscle groups are required - like Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift) Try the **Novice** version of Fierce 5 [https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931)\n\nBest of luck. Remember, this is not a race. The most results will occur over the first 12 months of this. Building sizable muscle will take years, but keep at it. As far as supplements, the only one I suggest is Creatine... Hope that helps..."

  "text": "Hi there, good on you for wanting to improve yourself, it's never too late:). What sort of equipment do you have at home? Depending on your goals, as to whether you're looking to gain muscle, lose fat etc, it would be best for you to know what your macronutrient &amp; caloric intake should look like. You can type your age, weight, height, activity level etc into this calculator below and it will work it out for you. It will give an approximate indication of how much protein, carbohydrates and fats you need to be consuming. You should aim to eat 1g of protein per 1lbs of your bodyweight and drink plenty of water:). \n\nhttps://www.katyhearnfit.com/macro-calculator\n\nMyFitnessPal is an awesome app by the way, you can enter all of your macros goals and keep track of what you are eating throughout the day.\n\nSo if you are looking to gain muscle or lose fat, either way, the best and more effective way to do it is by lifting heavy weights, by squatting, deadlifting, bench press etc...or at least eventually. \nBut if you are looking to workout at home, you could start with squatting with dumbells, also biceps curls, push ups, any other bodyweight exercises, like dips, burpees for cardio etc and get your form on point for all exercises. Then progress to lifting weights at the gym with pretty much the same exercises, as you will really make significantly more progress through lifting heavy weights. \n\nI don't use home workout sites/apps, so I couldn't recommend one in particular but there are plenty apps that you can download on googleplay. They'll get you started in the right direction and usually provide workouts for each muscle group.\n\nI hope that makes sense and helps you in some way, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions. Good luck:)♡.\n"

Mass gainers are a joke and a waste of money, and you maybe need one protein shake per day (if you can't get enough protein from REAL sources).  The creatine, if unflavored, can go in anything - I drink it during my workout.\n\nQuick tip - these are SUPPLEMENTS, not meal REPLACEMENTS.  If I were you, go out and buy a bunch of chicken breast, vegetables, and rice/pasta and learn how to meal prep.  It's a lot healthier, cleaner, and you get a ton more vitamins and minerals than that weight gainer...  EAT big to get BIG - no one ever said anything about drinking some shake (except the supplement industry)...\n\nHope that helps..."

  "text": " You'll need to look at this as a 3 piece puzzle.\n\n1. Your diet needs to be put in check. You really are what you EAT and getting your body in shape doesn't start by stepping into a gym, it starts on your plate. You need to eat BIG to get BIG.  Stop eating anything that comes from a bag, box, or can (that includes Weight Gainers!!). Get a meal tracking app to track what you stuff into your face. You need extra protein to pack on muscle. You need to monitor your calorie intake. I suggest the MyFitnessPal app - it will set up calorie goals automatically based on your exercise level and lifestyle. Eat more leafy greens. Eat whole foods (meat, rice, vegetables, fruit).  Eat a calorie surplus to gain weight.\n2. Sleep better. Building muscle doesn't end when you leave the gym, it continues throughout the day but mostly in your bed. You build muscle and burn fat in your sleep, not in a gym or running. Your body releases HGH at night so be sure to get 8-9 hours of sleep each night.\n3. Your routine. Walk 20 minutes per day to help burn fat (running is not suggested if you want to build muscle). I'd suggest doing full body workouts. Compound lifts (where multiple muscle groups are required - like Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift) Try the **Novice** version of [Fierce 5](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931).  It tells you when to raise the weight and everything!  \n\nBest of luck. Remember, this is not a race. The most results will occur over the first 12 months of this. Building sizable muscle will take years, but keep at it. As far as supplements, the only one I suggest is Creatine... Hope that helps..."

It took a few classes to get the hang of it, but most instructors are really good about giving cues as to what is coming up next to help you keep up. Like, they will raise two fingers on their right hand while doing something which means to repeat whatever they were doing twice on the left. Don't even worry about whether you look silly. No one is looking at you, promise! Your head has to be in it to keep up, which makes it therapeutic. I love it so much I sing the songs all week in anticipation, which drives my husband nuts, so... bonus! Commit to at least three classes before you decide whether it's for you (it is)."

My workout routine is Day 1: chest, triceps and shoulders. Day 2: back, biceps and traps. Day 3 is legs. Day 4/5 cardio (as I’m trying to cut weight while not losing mass) mix in abs throughout. I am by no means an expert but have had good results so far with this, im just trying to keep it simple.

Example being if 75lbs is maximum weight I can on triceps what I want to do is build myself up towards that maximum weight such as first rep @ 45lbs, second rep @ 55lbs, third at 65lbs and then make the last rep under the 75lbs maximum weight you will be able to build muscle/strength to eventually make your old maximum weight of 75lbs a new rep and then 85lbs will be your next goal.

Work out your legs to get them strong, you will also need upper body strength too cause your approach in vball for hitting is arms too. From there just do or find some home things like try jumping up the stairs two steps and do a few sets. Do jumps over a bench or something high and keep raising the height as it becomes easier. Also build up your core. Your body needs to be strong. Even if you want to do stuff to incorporate vball actions do wall jumps.

  "text": " You'll need to look at this as a 3 piece puzzle.\n\n1. Your diet needs to be put in check. You really are what you EAT and getting your body in shape doesn't start by stepping into a gym, it starts on your plate. You need to eat BIG to get BIG. Stop eating anything that comes from a bag, box, or can (that includes Weight Gainers!!). Get a meal tracking app to track what you stuff into your face. You need extra protein to pack on muscle. You need to monitor your calorie intake. I suggest the MyFitnessPal app - it will set up calorie goals automatically based on your exercise level and lifestyle. Eat more leafy greens. Eat whole foods (meat, rice, vegetables, fruit). Eat a calorie surplus to gain weight.\n2. Sleep better. Building muscle doesn't end when you leave the gym, it continues throughout the day but mostly in your bed. You build muscle and burn fat in your sleep, not in a gym or running. Your body releases HGH at night so be sure to get 8-9 hours of sleep each night.\n3. Your routine. Walk 20 minutes per day to help burn fat (running is not suggested if you want to build muscle). I'd suggest doing full body workouts. Compound lifts (where multiple muscle groups are required - like Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift) Try the **Novice** version of [Fierce 5](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=162916931). It tells you when to raise the weight and everything!  \n\n\nBest of luck. Remember, this is not a race. The most results will occur over the first 12 months of this. IN 24 months, you'll look better than 95% of guys out there.  Building sizable muscle will take years, but keep at it. As far as supplements, the only one I suggest is Creatine... Hope that helps..."

  "text": "Hi! I'm a kinesiology major with a concentration of Occupational Therapy. With my education through my university, we have been taught to not workout more than four days a week, with two of those day being a cardio endurance exercise and two days of muscular endurance. However or what ever works with your schedule, M, W, TH, and F would be a good example and starting point for a workout plan. Depending on what gym you attend, weight-lifting is my go to for muscular endurance whether it's machine or free weights. \n\nSo M - shoulders, arms, upper back. W - cardio exercise (your choice) TH - Legs, lower back. F - cardio \n\nDON'T FORGET TO STRETCH! \\*\\*\n\nSince you said you would start running, which is amazing since it may be outside. I don't recommend pushing yourself to where you can't walk the next day. With your experience playing soccer I'm confident you already knew that. You said that you work a desk job; this may sound silly but since you're sedentary for long periods of time. Try standing up once a hour just to get your heart pumping a little more. \n\nIn regards to diet, 80% of any \"abs\" are made in the kitchen and only 20% is exercising. Any soda that you may drink, scratch it; if you drink milk try Almond milk or Skim milk, I'm lactose intolerant so I drink Almond milk but it's 10xs healthier than regular 2% or whole milk. It also last a long time since it's made from almonds!\n\n Drop all sweets, any high in fats drop it. Chicken, Salmon, and any greens are your best friends. You have good and bad carbs but I recommend giving a good Google search and research on your own (I don't have a lot of experience with knowing the difference).\n\nTry to only eat two meals a day and small snacks in between. So maybe for breakfast make a bowl of oatmeal, I recommend overnight oatmeal (It's easy). For lunch have a small meal and have a couples of snacks until dinner such as, nuts, salads, protein packs. Not sure if you're on Pinterest often but they ofter meal plans that are easy to stand by! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps you get any ideas, if you have any more questions don't be afraid to ask! c:"

Work on areas people actually see every day on you like your neck, your forarms, your calves, and your arms.  Gain some decent size then cut.  I'm talking a good 5-year plan here but that's just me.

I know you don't WANT to right now but Drop the weight and slow your movements (Athlean X is really good about training muscle/str while dropping the weight on YouTube). Second, change up the exercises, there are a lot of different ones that aren't overhead press that aren't as demanding on your joints. Third, for now take an over the counter antiinflammatory. After a few weeks see if it goes away. If not get in for at least an x-ray asap you can REALLY permanently fuck up your joints because our bodies aren't meant to lift extremely heavy weights on our joints. Took me years of changing up HOW I worked out and learning the science behind each movement before I could lift comfortably without joint pain again. GL to you!"

This with my exercises with the flexbar on off days saved me.\nIt got to a point where I was waking up in the middle of the night almost every night of the week with insane elbow pain.

Once you reach a place where your weight doesn't go up or down - there's where your maintenance calories will be.  This will fluctuate so don't take it as gospel truth - just a ballpark.

Fortunately, many coaches now recommend the 45-degree arm angle, but this is still incorrect!\n\nPush-Up Elbow\n\nAlthough 45 degrees represents an improvement compared to extreme-elbow flare, it's not ideal. The shoulders and scapula still have additional room to move into a more centrated and packed position. When the scapulae fully retract, depress, and medially rotate towards the spine as they should, the arm and elbow position will be much closer to the torso – a 10 to 20 degree angle.\n\n \"Make a double chin\" is a common cue. But this can create a shortened and compressed cervical spine, which further leads to degradations in postural alignment, shoulder function, and neural signaling. Instead, the head and neck should be neutral, tall, and elongated on the spine.\n"

Remember that protein is helping you to repair your muscles so even if you exercise alot but don't take in enough protein you won't put on mass.\nAnother tip: stick to a good work out program. There are alot on the internet, or I can help ya with some if you want. Another option is to ask the trainer at your gym, it's their job to teach you not only what you should do, but how you should do it.\nHope I've been a bit helpful with this info ^.^"

It does sound like you need to up the weight and shorten the rest period to ultimately increase your intensity.  However, if your not noticing any weight loss results you also may need to look at your nutrition or \"diet\".  The obvious if your still eating to much food or to much fat/carbs, but also if your not eating enough, your body will still hold on to the fat.  Your body uses fat for energy, so it will burn some fat off, but if it thinks it is burning to much to fast, it will make changes and burn off some muscle instead and hold on to your fat to use later.\n\nWe recommend a food journal, so you can actually see what your eating and how much, and make adjustments to it.  track maybe just 2 days a week, then make small changes to 1 meal at a time and go for a week maybe 2 before you judge the results of the change and make another change.  It is not a quick fix, but when you do it right, you can stick to the changes and make lifestyle changes."

The earphones I have now have lasted me over a year and still work the same. They’re better sound quality and block out external sound better. Really the only issue I ever have with them is that they tend to slide off if I’m doing deadlifts. Although admittedly that’s one of the exercise where earbuds would fall out as well.

While strength and endurance performance improved similarly across the groups, the men training in the evening gained notably more muscle mass.\n\nLaczo et al. also presented the data at the 7th International Conference on Strength Training in 2010: more leg muscle growth after an afternoon training program than a morning one.\n\nMalhotra et al. (2014)  studied how training in the morning vs. the evening affected strength development. Strength gains were significantly greater in the evening for eccentric exercise: 29% vs. 23%. For concentric training, the trend was the same but less pronounced in favor of evening training with 23% vs. 21%.\n\nFacts:\n\nCortisol output is low at night, rapidly rises during awakening and then gradually decreases over the course of the day.the T/C ratio is highest in the afternoon and evening. During this period, exercise causes the smallest rise in cortisol and the largest increase in testosterone\n\nBased on the circadian rhythm of your hormones, gene expression and your core body temperature, the best time to schedule your training sessions is between 14:30 and 20:30 h if you have a normal biorhythm and sleep during the night from roughly 12:00 – 08:00 h."

That is, after the completion of all cycles you will take rest for 1 week with no training.\n\nHypertrophy: \n\nFor maximum muscle hypertrophy you have to keep your muscle protein synthesis at an elevated level. For that you should hit muscles after 48 hrs.\n\nCredentials:\n\nBryan Haycock, author and founder of the Hypertrophy-Specific Training (HST) method and Hypertrophy-Specific Nutrition (HSN), began lifting weights in 1978.  He has incorporated his passion for bodybuilding into his education as a physiologist and career as a writer and consultant for the sport supplement industry.\n\nFull body:\n\nThis kind of workout is implemented for training each muscles 3 times/week with enough rest period.\n\nBrosplit: \n\nAs I said before in brosplit you load a muscle once per week and the acute responses to training like increased protein synthesis, prostaglandins, IGF-1 levels, and mRNA levels all return to normal in about 36 hours.\n\n So, you get 2 days for growing specific muscles and half a week in a semi-anticatabolic state returning to normal. \n\n In brosplit you are wasting 5 useful days because you are training only once per week. \n\nVolume:\n\nVolume is very essential for muscle hypertrophy but you have to spread it throughout the week. \n\nRead the article again, everything is explained in it, it takes some time but you will learn a lot\n"

Just remember that you shouldn't slack on specific muscle groups, and you shouldn't only train strength or only cardio but make sure you do both. \n\nWhen it comes to strength exercises, it can be a bit tricky. I'd advise searching the web for beginner workout routines, and googling the specific exercises they recommend. \n\nCardio is a bit simpler. Go biking or go for a run. If you're out of breath while doing it, and your pulse is up, you'll be improving your cardio.\n\nRemember to always warm up. Don't start at the max intensity of your workout, or you'll risk getting hurt. A bit of light cardio training goes great as a warm up. \n\nI also wouldn't recommend training the same muscle group two days in a row, so alternate between muscle groups for strength. \n\nIf you're in this to lose weight, remember that both strength and cardio will help you. While running, you'll be burning more calories than while doing strength, but strength will burn calories in the long run, as it increases the amount of calories your body consumes constantly."

I was of the weakest in my high-school and i managed to do 30 pullups after 2 months of working out. Muscle and performance development is almost immediate when you are 14-16. My recommendation is to buy a pull-up bar and some weigts. Start running and do pull-up, pushups, abs, and just some simple exercises. Thats what i did because i also didnt have money and lived 6km from the nearest gym. Believe me, thats what i would do if i could go back in time.\n\nEat normal, don't worry too much about proteins and other stuff.

Eating just to gain weight doesn’t seem too advantageous, but I could be wrong. \n\nMy thought is that you should do some exercise to maintain physical fitness, and then move on to muscle gain as you progress with your diet. This way, you don’t gain weight and have to overcome a new barrier when you decide to try and put on mass. \n\nI’m 145lbs, roughly 5’11”, and I can put on muscle weight fairly quickly when I watch my diet. Granted that is more of a metabolic comparison, so our gain receptivity could be totally different, but it can’t hurt to at least try. Your body will maintain a certain weight regardless due to biological necessities, so long as you maintain a normal diet. So if nothing else, you’ll feel healthier from working out and may even slowly put on mass depending on your caloric intake.\n\nTLDR: as long as you take in more calories than you’re burning, you should put on weight. How fast you put on the weight depends on the ratio of burning calories/consuming calories I would guess"

  "text": "Noob logic is that if you spend more time in the gym, you'll see better results.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  If you want to build muscle, there are 3 things you must remember:\n\n1. EAT big to get BIG.  building muscle doesn't start when you step foot in the gym.  It starts on your plate!!  If you aren't eating enough, it won't matter how long or how many times you step in the gym - your muscles will be starving!  Track your calories and EAT protein\n2. Rest!  Building muscle doesn't end when you step out of the gym.  It continues when you REST your muscles!!  Get deep restful sleep at night - you get healthy doses of HGH at night.  That also means that you shouldn't workout the same muscles within 48 hours to allow for full protein synthesis to occur\n3. Workout routine.  Find one that works and stick to it for at least 3 months before switching it up.  If you're a noob, I highly recommend [Fierce 5](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=159678631&amp;pagenumber=1) it's an excellent place to start and will get you strong quickly if followed to the T.\n\nOne last thing:  This is not a race - you'll see the most gains in the first 12 months and within 24 months, you'll look better than 95% of guys out there...  This isn't rocket science... be patient, don't over do it, listen to your body, and make them gains...\n\nHope that helps..."

An easy formula to start with would be 3 sets of 6 reps at roughly 80 to 85% of your max.\n\nIt will take time to see the results, but if you stick with it, you'll definitely be able to build!

I’m a skinny person naturally and when I started working out I lost some weight initially (mostly fat and water weight) and within a month I had gained it all back and then some in muscle. But to gain weight with a high metabolism and a good workout routine isn’t easy. I had to force my body to accept a lot more calories than it’s used to. It took a couple months of eating even when I’m not hungry but now I’m just that hungry, it’s helped a lot with gaining a significant amount of muscle mass.\n\nBasically, you’re gonna have to force feed yourself a fuck ton of food but yes you should workout."

I would recommend watching Athlean X on YouTube, he has some amazing videos, and not just for core, but everything.\n\n*Friday: Arm Day\n-Preacher Curls\n-Nosebreakers (AKA Skullcrushers)\n-Farmers Walk\n-Hammer Curls\n-Tricep Overhead Extension\n-Wrist Flexion/Extension\n\nPlenty of work you could do adding to/subtracting from this setup, but it's a really good jumping off point, and can work the way it is, if you want.\n\nEdit: Attempting to fix phone formatting"

For me I need a mix of cardio and weight training to get the results I am looking for. \n\nWhat are your eating habits like? Do you eat a lot of fried foods or pasta? (My two favorite things) Are you like me and still refuse to eat your vegetables? Most of the research I've found boils down to cut the crap out of your diet and eat more healthy foods. I know for me that I can't go cold turkey, but if I make sure to have more of the healthy stuff on my plate, I don't feel bad about eating the tasty stuff. For example, have one slice of pizza but pair it with a side salad and water instead of cheesy bread and a coke. You'll want to look at portion sizes and how much of what to eat for a given meal. Eating too much food, even if it's healthy, is still too much food and will cause you to continue putting on weight. \n\nIt's all about making small changes to your lifestyle, that is how you will not only lose the weight but also keep it off.

  "text": "I have/had almost the exact same measurements as you. I’m 6’4 and was 229lbs (currently at 189 and much leaner than before) before starting to workout. In my opinion, cause I’m by no means a personal trainer, is to just start working out. If you kind of know a bit about lifting and nutrition, then you’ll get what I’m saying. When I started out when I was 229lbs all I did was drastically cut calories and do a bunch of cardio with average weight training.... this is not something I recommend. What I personally recommend is eat at a caloric maintenance and or just below maintenance for a while. Reason being you’ll have your noobie gains, the size and strength gains you get when first starting out. By eating at maintenance and or just below, your body goes into a “recomposition” period where you’ll lose fat and gain muscle but since you’re eating at or just below caloric maintenance, your body will use fat for fuel and optimize muscle growth. If you know what bulking and cutting is, don’t cut first. Bulk, just bulk at a caloric maintenance. This is because if you just start trying to lose weight drastically, you’ll have minimal noobie gains, you’ll lose a bunch of fat, and be stuck looking like a sickly skinny twig. Bulking on the other hand (for a couple months) will benefit you because you’ll put on good lean muscle for a while. This way when you do cut down, you’ll have lean muscle to show for after. May seem like it’ll take longer than you like to get to what you want, but much worth it in the end. One tip, just don’t cut calories too low when cutting, cause then you’ll lose the hard earned muscle you just gained. "

Eat more than your maintenance and you gain weight (both muscle and body fat), but eat less than your maintenance and you lose weight (also both muscle and fat with the exception of your noobie muscle gains for the first 6 months). Look up online your “TDEE”. Stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure, this is the amount of calories you burn a day. Google a “TDEE Calculator” Be honest in the activity questions for the quiz.

Get comfortable with the bar and start putting on plates. as you progressively put more weight on, the stronger and bigger youll become. Fat cannot be target burned with a particular exercise, but i suggest trying different forms of cardio and just picking the one that suits you the most. I dont like swimming but love biking some sweat off. watch athlean x’s videos on youtube... online research is good if from the right people!"

  "text": "It sounds like you need a routine that is both cardio based and resistance training based. The cardio will help your lungs recover from the years of smoking. It will also help you lose fat to some degree. If you’re 25 you really shouldn’t have any trouble jogging. Walking really isn’t worth the time at your current age/weight especially if you’re already walking all day. Biking works too. The only issue with biking is that since it’s only lower body, you have to work extra hard to burn the same amount of calories. Also, yes you will lose size (if you want an explanation of why, I’ll leave it at the bottom of this reply). \n\nAs for resistance training, kettlebells are a decent option. They are kind of limited in terms of the amount of exercises you can do. However, most of those exercises are full body and very efficient. If you have the ability to join a gym I’d recommend it as it will open up your options and help keep things interesting. \n\nAs for the protein shakes, no they are not required. However, you will need to increase your protein intake if you want to build muscle. Especially, if you are in a caloric deficit which you will need to be to lose weight. Protein shakes are a good option for beginners because they’re a guaranteed way to make sure you get your protein on a daily basis. But they can be rough on your digestive system and eating real foods is arguably healthier. I like to just make sure I eat meat multiple times per day and I usually hit my daily protein requirement. \n\nBack to cycling causing “muscle loss”. There are two types of muscle fibers, type 1 and type 2 (technically there’s actually 3 types, one in between but it’s easier to conceptualize just thinking about the two types.) Type 1 muscle fibers deal with endurance. They are very dense meaning they are small. Type 2 deal with power and they are large. So what happens when you do a lot of endurance training is the type 1 fibers hypertrophy while the type 2 fibers atrophy. This leads to a net decrease in overall size even though you’re still technically building muscle. It’s just dense muscle at the cost of larger muscle fibers. "

The problem is you will struggle with form as its too heavy and you'll need to deload. So start with the bar as form is crucial and trust me the weight does go up very quicky and you will be cursing the hell out of me."

 {
  "text": "Sworkit is a pretty good app for home workouts. Not a bad place to start. Definitely don’t do one muscle group for a week and then a different muscle group the next week. The way working out works, is you are breaking down/tearing the muscle fibers on a microscopic level. Your body rebuilds that muscle in between workouts to be bigger and stronger than before that way it can withstand the next workout (protein is the primary energy source your body uses to build this muscle). This rebuilding process takes about 24 hours for type 1 fibers and 48-72 hours for type 2 fibers. \n\nSo basically you can do the same cardio exercise every day. I would jog primarily and bike once or twice a week to mix it up. \n\nFor resistance training you have to give yourself more time to recover. So it’s best to either do everything on one day and then take a few days off from resistance training. Or you can split up the muscle groups throughout the week. Upper body/lower body is my favorite 2-day split for beginners. Push/pull/legs or upper/lower/core are good 3-day splits as well. It kind of just depends on how much resistance training you want to do each week. The more days of the week you want to lift, the more days you need to split it up. \n\nAs for overall rest days, you’re going to need them. Even if you perfectly design your workouts so that every day your muscles should be recovered. Your nervous system and your cardiovascular system get taxed if there’s too many consecutive workouts in a row. I find that 6 days per week should be the max amount that you should do. And you should build up to that. Start out with 3 or 4. You can sometimes get away with going more than 6 days in a row but eventually your body will need some designated time to recover. \n\nI was mostly self taught. I had some coaches help me with form and exercise design when I was young and in sports. But as I grew out of sports and really focused on exercise I had to teach myself. I mostly used YouTube and google. Then I tested everything I read/heard. If it didn’t work for me, then I trusted the source less. Later down the road I decided to become a personal trainer and major in health and human performance. So I do have a formal education with this stuff on top of all of the research I did on my own. But I will say, I already knew most of the things they were teaching in school because I had already looked it up myself first. So you definitely don’t need a formal education if you find the right teachers. Some of the Youtubers I learned the most from back then were StrengthCamp, CT Fletcher, Barbell Brigade, OmarIsuf, ChristianGuzman, and Tiger Fitness. \n\nI don’t watch as many videos like that any more because I don’t feel like I need that knowledge from external sources anymore. But some of my favorites that I still watch now are Jeff Nippard, MI40 Muscle Intelligence, Damien Patrick, and Mike Rashid. \n\nI know pretty much all these YouTubers are male so they may not appeal to you as much. I’m sure there are plenty of great female fitness youtubers out there you can learn from too. "

  "text": "Bulking up can be summed up into 3 puzzle pieces.  You get all the puzzle pieces together, you'll have yourself a roadmap to decent gains.  \n\n1. Your diet.  Food is the foundation of any athlete - you literally ARE what you eat.  If you eat crap, your body will look like crap.  Stop eating anything that comes out of a can or box and all fast food - you're actually spending way too much on it anyways - the cost per ounce is ridiculous.  Learn to eat single-ingredient foods (Rice, Chicken, fish, steak, and vegetables).  Your wallet and your body will thank you.  If you're working out around 3-4 days per week, you need to be getting at least 2500 calories per day give-or-take.  Get a meal tracking app (MyFitnesPal is excellent) and start tracking everything you shove into your face.\n2. Sleep.  You need to be getting a good 8-9 hours of deep restful sleep per day to allow your body to recover and get HGH - yes your body releases healthy doses of HGH to help repair and build muscles while you SLEEP.\n3. Your routine - without the two pieces above, this part will not matter.  But if you have your diet in check and are getting good sleep, get a good strength building routine.  Your equipment is limited but try and do as much as you can in the [Fierce 5](https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=159678631&amp;pagenumber=1) routine.  It's excellent and will provide gains for months\n\nYou should be seeing about a pound of weight increase each week.  This is not a race.  Building up your body is a marathon and you'll need to grind each week.  You'll see the most gains in your first year but sizable muscle will take years.  Be patient and just remember these 3 principles.  \n\nHope that helps."

I suggest following [IIFYM](https://www.iifym.com/) to find out your macros\n2. Sleep - You build muscle in your sleep - not in the gym!  That means you also need rest days or you won't get bigger.\n3.

Just be sure to keep your chest up, back straight when doing these and adjust the weight according to you strength. Too much weight you'll injure yourself.

  "text": "I’d argue that you’re not getting enough frequency on your squats and you have too much unnecessary volume in your legs competing for resources.\n\nRead [“The Body Builders’ Cure”](http://www.bakerstrengthcoaching.com/body-builders-cure/) by Andy Baker. (I’m assuming your goal is hypertrophy and not strength. If strength is your goal, then switching to a program such as Barbell Medicine’s The Bridge or Andy Baker’s Garage Gym Warrior would be more appropriate.)\n\nBecause you cramp at 95x6x2 (weight x reps x sets), however, instead of doing a 5x5 on Monday, a light squat on Wednesday, and 10-20x3 (reps x sets) on Friday, I would have you just do 5x3 starting with something close to 55-65 lbs adding 5-10 lbs every workout.\n\nBe sure to post a recording of your squat with weight to a sub that allows it (I see no rules that prohibit form checks in this sub). Try to record at hip height from a 4-5 o’clock back angle with your feet and head in picture when you are at the top of the rep. Tag me if you’d like, I’d be happy to give you instructions and cues.\n\nQuestions?"

  "text": "Starting Strength. Whether your goal is strength, hypertrophy, or improvement of your general well-being, there is no better place to start, IMO. It will only last 2-5 months, and then you will need to switch to something that is more specific to your goal and has more complexity and volume, but in those 2-5 months, you will improve many aspects of fitness.\n\nIf you’re interested, let me know. I’ll share the best resources for beginners I have."

  "text": "[Beginner’s Guide to Starting Strength](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLysAlJk_rr63E46OmjMuvWmqhFCzmfvC7)\n\nLosing weight is a noble goal (assuming you are actually overweight [BMI of 25 or more]). This is done primarily through diet, however. Of course, you want to lose fat not lean body mass (muscle, tendon, bone, etc. abreviated: LBM), and engaging in resistance training promotes the retention of LBM.\n\nAs far as nice abs goes, I’m going to broaden your goal to mean that you want to have a pleasing appearance. Correct me if I’m wrong. Having visible abs that look pleasing is really the final piece of the puzzle to looking good naked (which is really subjective, and the standard for men in society should be lowered IMO), and the truth is, it takes much longer (years) to get there than what you are normally told unless you are using specific drugs that are illegal in most countries. So it’s better to focus on looking better in clothing first (which means bigger shoulders, back, and legs) while building a chest in which you can place your six pack. (Do you understand the analogy?) If you are unconvinced, listen to [this interview ](https://barbell-logic.com/110-end-dad-bod-the-secret-no-ones-talking-about-with-robert-santana/) with strength and conditioning coach (S&amp;CC)/registered dietitian (RD) Robert Santana.\n\nAs far as diet is concerned, I recommend following these two articles in order: [“Should you ‘go on a diet?’”](http://www.weightsandplates.com/should-you-go-on-a-diet/) by Robert Santana and [“Cut Calories Last”](https://startingstrengthonlinecoaching.com/39/) by S&amp;CC Matt Reynolds. Don’t go on any fad diets such as keto, intermittent, zone, etc. Learn proper habits first, portion your macronutrients second, add conditioning third, and cut calories last.\n\n(Note: BMI is a good measure for the untrained population, but after a few months, you will no longer be a part of that demographic. Monitoring [waist circumference with a tape measure](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/how-to-measure-your-waist-correctly/) is going to be a much more reliable tool.)\n\nQuestions? Concerns?"
